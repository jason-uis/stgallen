136.83,"we're going to cut your taxes"
138.6,"massively and you know people"
143.34,"don't understand but Hillary"
144.84,"Clinton is raising your taxes"
146.58,"very substantial tax increase so"
149.25,"people don't just have we're"
151.95,"going to renegotiate our"
153.51,"disastrous trade deals"
155.94,"we're going to protect our"
157.29,"country from radical Islamic"
160.05,"terrorism that one's not even"
167.07,"close over the weekend there"
170.459,"were Islamic terrorist attacks"
172.59,"in Minnesota new york city and"
175.14,"in New Jersey these attacks were"
178.02,"made possible because of our"
180.03,"extremely open immigration"
181.56,"system which fails to properly"
184.05,"vet and screen the individuals"
186.51,"or families coming into our"
187.86,"country attack after attack from"
191.01,"9-11 to San Bernardino to"
193.11,"orlando we have seen how failure"
195.51,"to screen who is entering the"
197.58,"United States puts all of our"
200.55,"citizens in great danger"
203.22,"so let me state this very very"
205.68,"clearly and as you know at least"
208.739,"most of you know I've been"
211.05,"saying this for a long time"
213.36,"this didn't just happen like"
214.65,"yesterday immigration security"
218.64,"is national security"
225.16,"now I assume she'll be changing"
229.33,"this but you know what's been"
230.53,"happening my opponent has the"
233.14,"most open borders policy of"
235.75,"anyone ever to seek the office"
239.32,"of presidency"
240.79,"it's not even close as Secretary"
243.46,"of State she allowed thousands"
245.08,"of criminal aliens to be"
246.43,"released into our communities"
247.93,"because their home countries"
249.94,"wouldn't take them back they"
251.62,"were too bad they didn't want"
253.48,"them so we took them now Obama"
256.51,"wants to bring in as of two days"
259.09,"ago an additional one hundred"
261.37,"and ten thousand refugees and"
263.92,"Hillary once I mean honestly"
268.63,"honestly it's hard to believe"
270.88,"and hillary wants a five hundred"
273.13,"and fifty percent increase in"
275.02,"Syrian refugees altogether"
278.17,"Hillary Clinton's plan would"
280.66,"bring in 620,000 refugees in her"
283.93,"first term alone with no"
285.88,"effective way to screen or vet"
288.58,"them her plan would cause 400"
291.49,"billion dollars in terms of"
293.11,"lifetime welfare and entitlement"
295.93,"costs"
297.19,"this isn't just a matter of"
298.54,"terrorism but also a matter of"
302.32,"quality of life and many of you"
304.9,"are just starting off on this"
306.19,"incredible journey and it is"
308.56,"about quality of life and it's"
310.12,"about safety know about safety"
311.5,"is very important"
317.47,"have to have a safe country we"
322.54,"want to make sure we are only"
324.61,"admitting people into our"
326.05,"country who love our country my"
333.79,"highest duty as president is to"
335.86,"protect our citizens and to"
337.54,"appall the Constitution of the"
339.94,"United States I will honor that"
342.52,"duty to the fullest extent every"
345.31,"single day and I will never"
347.23,"waver in that sacred obligation"
350.71,"it's just a plain fact that our"
353.11,"current immigration system makes"
355.45,"no real attempt to determine the"
357.19,"views of the people entering our"
360.88,"country we have no idea who they"
363.37,"are what they think since nine"
366.04,"eleven hundreds of immigrants"
367.75,"and their children have been"
369.43,"implicated in terrorism and"
371.74,"terrorist related activity"
373.48,"within the united states now we"
376.69,"learned that another 858"
379.09,"immigrants is just the other day"
381.31,"from dangerous countries have"
384.13,"slipped into our country and"
386.14,"been granted citizenship"
388.36,"despite the fact that they were"
390.4,"supposed to be deported"
392.5,"they probably press the wrong"
393.97,"button on a computer so they"
396.22,"were supposed to be deported and"
398.89,"they were given citizenship"
401.169,"welcome to America"
405.969,"we're gonna build a wall looking"
410.709,"at them"
412.929,"we're gonna be"
415.93,"we're going to build the wall"
417.88,"Mexico's gonna pay for the wall"
419.68,"100 but the over 800 people"
428.59,"really had nothing to do with"
430.81,"the wall you know they had to do"
433.66,"with a lot of other things and"
435.91,"it's a very very sick can you"
437.289,"imagine we made them citizens"
438.91,"and they were getting ready for"
439.93,"deportation so either something"
443.71,"was very wrong or they press the"
445.09,"wrong button on the computer but"
446.949,"either way can have it all"
449.32,"together there are nearly 1"
451.81,"million individuals in the"
453.52,"United States with deportation"
455.38,"orders who have not yet been"
457.9,"removed in the 20th century the"
460.69,"United States defeated fascism"
462.97,"nausea ism and communism now we"
467.11,"must defeat radical Islamic"
469.87,"terrorism"
474.12,"yet my opponent won't even say"
479.25,"the words radical Islamic terror"
482.46,"in fact Hillary Clinton talks"
485.01,"tougher about my supporters than"
487.26,"she does about Islamic"
489.03,"terrorists she calls the"
495.33,"patriotic Americans who support"
497.25,"our campaign many of them cops"
499.169,"and soldiers deplorable and"
501.96,"irredeemable as she ever talk"
507.24,"that way about radical Islam or"
509.729,"about those who oppose and"
512.07,"murder women and gays overseas"
514.919,"know as Hillary Clinton never"
517.11,"call people to support these"
518.55,"practices deplorable or"
521.43,"irredeemable know in many"
524.46,"countries overseas non-believers"
526.74,"face the death penalty"
528.9,"whether it's Hillary's"
530.49,"condemnation and then where is"
532.08,"it where is a condemnation of"
534.24,"these people"
536.1,"where is your condemnation of"
537.75,"these countries let's ask"
540.18,"Hillary how many people who"
542.73,"subscribe to radical Islamic"
545.279,"views and support the oppression"
546.959,"of non-believers would you call"
548.91,"deplorable more irredeemable"
551.52,"that's a terrible word that"
552.779,"hasn't been reported but that"
554.16,"was a word that you used are"
556.14,"those words reserved only for"
557.88,"hardworking Americans that truly"
559.86,"truly support us and truly love"
562.8,"our country seems that way"
564.6,"America can never elected"
567.36,"president like Hillary Clinton"
569.31,"who apparently with her choice"
571.17,"of words thinks that the decent"
573.24,"American citizens are bigger"
574.92,"threat than radical Islam can't"
578.67,"do this"
579.42,"anyone who cannot name our enemy"
581.97,"is not fit to lead this country"
584.94,"remember"
588.98,"and if you can't name your enemy"
594.709,"you don't know what the problem"
595.82,"is and if you don't know what"
597.29,"the problem is you never gonna"
598.579,"fix the problem"
600.079,"anyone who cannot condemn the"
601.94,"hatred oppression and violence"
603.5,"of radical Islam lacks the moral"
606.29,"clarity to serve as our"
608.209,"president the commander-in-chief"
610.279,"of this nation must speak with"
613.19,"moral clarity and conviction our"
616.43,"system of government is the best"
618.41,"in the world and as your"
619.94,"president I will defend our"
621.649,"values and speak out against"
623.839,"those who assault our values in"
626.209,"any way shape or form right it's"
638.18,"also time to remember one very"
640.04,"important word accountability"
642.019,"all this disaster with Isis"
644.089,"happened on Hillary Clinton's"
645.829,"watch happened with her her bad"
649.19,"judgment her bad decision-making"
652.22,"her policies in Iraq and Libya"
654.29,"and Syria are responsible for"
656.72,"the rise of Isis her attacks on"
660.44,"me are all meant to deflect from"
662.839,"her record of unleashing this"
664.97,"monstrous evil upon us ever"
667.85,"notice oh she does is attack me"
669.41,"constantly attack attack"
671.569,"everyone says you should never"
673.13,"be successful never run for"
674.66,"political office but that's the"
676.43,"kind of person you need hate to"
678.68,"tell you that that's what we"
679.819,"need but they've always said all"
681.769,"my life all of my life I've"
685.67,"heard of your successful never"
687.05,"run for political office but"
689,"it's time we have to bring our"
690.56,"country back we have to make our"
692.209,"country great again we have to"
693.68,"do something because it's not"
695.66,"working right now"
697.279,"the waiting's her time terrible"
702.92,"and it's you know this is so"
704.779,"true her timetable and"
706.97,"withdrawal from Iraq her push"
709.819,"for regime change in Libya and"
712.279,"Syria her open border policies"
715.37,"these are the actions that"
716.69,"unleashed the ISIS disaster so"
720.649,"she will say and do anything to"
722.36,"distract from that record of"
724.88,"total failure and let's see how"
726.949,"much she changes her policies"
728.99,"over the next couple of days"
730.22,"because she's been for open"
732.11,"borders"
732.98,"she's from people pouring in"
734.39,"from Syria she's from all of"
736.339,"these things I think it's"
737.959,"getting very hard for anybody"
739.579,"that's rational or even same if"
742.819,"you look at it"
743.51,"I mean how can people believe"
744.949,"this way how can they do that"
747.74,"how can people believe this when"
750.41,"they see what's happening all"
751.76,"over the world"
753.019,"look at Germany look at what"
754.64,"happened to merkel in the recent"
757.25,"election look at what's going on"
759.98,"we have to use common sense we"
762.829,"have to be smart we have to be"
764.48,"tough we have to be vigilant her"
766.49,"claim that my opposition to"
768.47,"radical Islamic terrorism is a"
770.81,"recruiting tool to what how does"
773.089,"that have to do with them being"
773.99,"tough"
775.04,"why is that are recruiting I'm"
776.24,"much tougher than her on this"
778.67,"prop is horrible situation but"
780.98,"she goes around saying its"
782,"recruiting to you know somebody"
783.439,"gave her that from madison"
784.79,"avenue you know about it that's"
785.959,"advertising they gave her that"
788.3,"from that they said let's go to"
789.5,"recruiting to but why because"
792.17,"I'm tough"
792.98,"it's a recruiting to it"
794.87,"demonstrates a level of"
796.31,"ignorance about the terror"
798.05,"threat that really is"
799.73,"disqualifying for a person"
802.31,"seeking the presidency when she"
803.72,"says my opposition to radical"
806.18,"Islamic terror provides aid and"
808.01,"comfort to the enemy"
809.29,"we know that Hillary Clinton has"
812.139,"once again demonstrated that"
813.699,"she's really unfit for office"
824.42,"her comments are not only"
825.92,"reckless but beneath the dignity"
828.26,"of the office that she six Isis"
831.23,"is torturing murdering executing"
833.69,"and exterminating people in a"
835.91,"campaign of Genesis and why does"
838.519,"Hillary Clinton suggesting what"
840.74,"is she suggesting you know what"
843.05,"you see"
843.5,"let's let more people come in"
844.82,"that we should censor our"
847.699,"vocabulary so as not to upset"
850.07,"these butchers I have news for"
854.81,"Hillary refusing to call out"
857.63,"radical Islam will not lessen"
861.26,"the danger it will only increase"
863.51,"and embolden the danger just"
865.459,"like we have seen during a"
866.81,"disastrous and failed term as"
868.76,"Secretary of State it in"
870.56,"Bolton's"
877.79,"just like Iran is emboldened you"
880.07,"look at Iran there on baldon"
881.63,"they made this deal and instead"
883.61,"of becoming our friend"
885.62,"it looks to me like it's gotten"
887.39,"worse"
888.71,"the rise of Isis is Hillary"
890.33,"Clinton's foreign policy legacy"
892.28,"one of them many others that are"
896.24,"not good"
897.62,"Secretary Clinton has helped to"
899.63,"topple regimes displace millions"
901.58,"and then open the door to Isis"
904.07,"potentially to enter this"
905.78,"country now you think of this"
908.36,"it's a disaster so how is this"
910.55,"policy a smart policy Clinton's"
914,"decisions overseas have left us"
916.4,"with the threat we face today"
917.84,"and her immigration policies"
920.12,"will invite this thread onto our"
922.16,"shores as soon as us as sure as"
924.68,"you are there in front of me"
926.51,"standing watching that's going"
929.06,"to happen right onto our shows"
930.65,"it's happening"
932.6,"we must stop the massive inflow"
934.37,"of refugees which Hillary"
936.2,"Clinton is trying to drastically"
937.94,"increase now she may change your"
940.49,"mind because this is what's been"
941.84,"happening for a long time but"
943.46,"it's getting harder and harder"
944.54,"because how ru electable when"
947.18,"you have policies like that we"
949.34,"should temporarily suspend"
950.66,"immigration entirely from"
952.04,"regions were safe and adequate"
953.69,"screening and I mean extreme"
956.45,"vetting cannot occur right"
963.699,"q polling shows that in many of"
967.359,"the countries from which we draw"
968.829,"a large numbers of immigrants"
970.239,"extreme views about religion"
972.669,"such as the death penalty for"
974.529,"those who leave the faith are"
977.109,"commonplace the death penalty"
979.749,"it's the job and really of"
982.179,"government to admit those and"
985.089,"only those who we expect to"
987.249,"succeed in to flourish here and"
989.47,"become part of our incredible"
992.259,"country and home"
1000.71,"Hillary Clinton disagrees with"
1002.36,"his common sense rule and it's"
1004.55,"one more reason why she will not"
1007.61,"win the election on $MONTH"
1009.71,"november and it's time to break"
1018.35,"with the corruption the bad"
1020.69,"judgment and the failures of the"
1022.7,"past it's time to have a new"
1025.61,"American future we are going to"
1029.209,"change our immigration system to"
1033.5,"reflect American values"
1036.35,"we're going to stop the policy"
1042.62,"of regime change overseas and"
1044.81,"instead focus on working with"
1046.4,"our allies on a military"
1047.839,"campaign to utterly destroy Isis"
1050.87,"and defeat Islamic terrorism"
1055.31,"this will not only require"
1059.18,"military warfare but also"
1061.07,"financial warfare cyber warfare"
1063.14,"and ideological warfare but to"
1066.53,"win this struggle we need to be"
1068.15,"strong at home we're going to"
1071,"rebuild our country our"
1072.95,"infrastructure is a disaster"
1075.41,"our country is a mess with 20"
1078.86,"trillion dollars in debt think"
1081.74,"of it 20 trillion dollars at the"
1085.16,"center of the effort will be in"
1087.68,"fact the rebuilding of our inner"
1089.96,"cities nearly four in ten"
1092.3,"african-american children live"
1094.31,"in poverty including forty-five"

1132.26,"the war-torn nations that"
1133.88,"you're looking at that's worse"
1134.81,"than Afghanistan the schools are"
1137.54,"failing the jobs are leaving and"
