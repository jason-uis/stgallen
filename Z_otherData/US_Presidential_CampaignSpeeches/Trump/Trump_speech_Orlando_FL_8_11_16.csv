15.66,"special guy and i'm glad i"
18.09,"didn't get into too much of the"
20.01,"debate with him because I could"
21.3,"have been very unattractive"
22.529,"especially for me because he's"
25.89,"tough but he's a good he's a"
28.23,"good man and I appreciate Mike"
29.67,"being here so i had a long"
31.38,"beautiful speech written and I"
32.55,"read it I said boy this is"
33.63,"boring"
34.59,"this is not what we want to talk"
36.57,"about because I know a lot of"
38.79,"the pastor's i know some of the"
40.05,"pastors in the room and I refuse"
42.87,"to put them to sleep right so"
45.39,"take down those teleprompters"
46.92,"let's talk let's talk"
49.35,"and I thought I tell you a story"
51.93,"that took place not so long ago"
55.8,"in a big conference room in a"
57.84,"building in Manhattan and we had"
62.129,"many pastors in that contrasts"
65.4,"and we're about 55 people we"
67.86,"have many pastors who"
68.79,"administers we two rabbis great"
73.26,"people and it was maybe six"
77.729,"months ago and it was before"
79.59,"that also we had a number of"
80.939,"meetings and i noticed there's"
83.22,"tremendous strength tremendous"
86.04,"power from these people they"
87.42,"were tremendously powerful"
88.77,"people their personalities their"
91.29,"speech they would speak so"
93.63,"beautifully"
94.619,"I'm used to hearing real estate"
96.27,"people in New York they don't"
97.259,"speak so beautifully at all but"
100.5,"they're smart and they're tough"
101.97,"but such beautiful words such"
106.049,"great people in the room and I"
108.72,"could see I'm pretty good at"
110.04,"this I know when people like me"
111.39,"I know when people don't like me"
113.7,"and that's okay"
116.67,"either way i prefer the liking"
118.079,"but sometimes it doesn't work"
119.369,"out no matter what you do and i"
121.979,"listened to all of the people"
124.59,"would go around the room and"
126.119,"they're very religious people"
130.03,"they're believers they believe"
132.88,"so much in religious liberty as"
136.03,"I do very much because without"
140.47,"religious liberty you don't have"
141.97,"Liberty can you have liver and"
145.959,"and some of these pastors and"
152.86,"ministers and in both cases the"
156.4,"rabbis have tremendous"
158.44,"tremendous followings and"
160.959,"tremendous congregations and we"
164.98,"had one meeting we're probably"
168.13,"the third one was the biggest"
170.44,"people the biggest people and I"
174.819,"could see this love for Donald"
176.68,"Trump we want you to win mr."
178.75,"Trump we want you to win and so"
181.81,"I said we'll pray for me and"
183.76,"they had no problem they did"
186.16,"that immediately they form the"
189.489,"circle we grabbed everything was"
191.44,"beautiful"
192.01,"pray for me but then I said I"
196.81,"hope you can get out there and"
199.45,"really support me and fight for"
203.23,"me and endorse me and all of"
205.9,"those political things and i saw"
208.959,"there was like silence in the"
211.87,"room"
212.41,"silence and I said what's this"
216.67,"what is going on why is their"
218.62,"silence why where's where was"
220.75,"the enthusiasm i mean i could"
223.269,"see they really liked me they"
226,"know I get it I one with"
229.6,"evangelicals in the primary i"
231.82,"mean i would go into a state and"
233.65,"remember at the beginning I go"
235,"into say well he can't win that"
236.44,"state because that's evangelical"
238.18,"and that I've win with"
238.989,"evangelicals in massive numbers"
241.239,"and pastor Jeffers would be on"
245.799,"television let's say he was a"
248.019,"great just great he was always"
249.459,"so good on television and he is"
251.35,"a great way of speaking and it's"
253.239,"a Donald Trump may not be"
254.799,"perfect but he knows how to win"
257.38,"and maybe he's not as good"
261.389,"and maybe he's not as perfect on"
264.599,"the Bible but I did go to Sunday"
267.93,"school for many years I want to"
269.219,"tell you carry but he said he"
272.639,"may not be perfect but he's ours"
275.699,"and Jerry Falwell Jr got up and"
280.83,"he said something that was very"
282.749,"interesting he said when ronald"
286.169,"reagan and Jimmy Carter were"
287.55,"running you had one who was"
290.249,"absolutely perfect Sunday school"
292.8,"teacher"
293.669,"Jimmy Carter knew every word in"
296.31,"the Bible a good person a very"
298.409,"good person and Ronald Reagan"
301.349,"who had gone through a divorce"
302.46,"and was probably not on paper"
306.779,"the same and jerry jr who by the"
312.569,"way is a fantastic person"
314.819,"Jerry said his father was under"
317.069,"tremendous pressure to from the"
321.479,"church groups and from the"
323.009,"evangelicals to endorse to me"
326.009,"corner and he said I can't talk"
328.949,"I can't do it and that was when"
332.009,"you had the Iran hostage crisis"
333.779,"and lot of bad things were"
335.129,"happening to our country through"
336.839,"weakness is happening through"
338.699,"weakness and he said I can't do"
340.919,"it any endorsed Ronald Reagan"
343.68,"and he was always so proud of"
346.649,"that decision and jerry jr would"
349.319,"tell me that was one of the"
350.399,"great decisions and it was a"
351.96,"great decision because you're"
353.279,"talking about a great president"
355.919,"turned out to be a great"
356.849,"president but pastor Jeffers"
360.569,"would get up and say he's not"
362.49,"perfect but he knows how to win"
364.8,"he's gonna win for us and I said"
367.83,"I like that guy never met him"
369.06,"but then I got to meet him is"
370.5,"fantastic I and he said things"
373.11,"that were just very nice and I"
374.399,"appreciate it"
375.36,"we have such great support with"
376.649,"the evangelical community the"
378.93,"Christian community really"
380.819,"largely the religious community"
382.589,"so I'm in the room with many of"
386.279,"the pastors and some ministers"
389.88,"and they're going like well we"
392.76,"can't really do that I said why"
397.26,"why why can't you do that I"
399.9,"don't understand"
400.89,"I know you like me why aren't"
402.39,"you endorsing well we just can't"
403.65,"I said why these was strong men"
406.38,"all of a sudden they're saying"
407.37,"and women women we had Reverend"
412.92,"Paula a terrific person by the"
415.14,"way terrific and we had some"
418.62,"others that were amazing and"
420.21,"they become friends of mine but"
422.34,"they're strong people and they"
424.14,"said we can't do it i said why"
425.88,"they don't want to tell me and"
427.32,"it wasn't that they didn't want"
428.19,"to tell me it's almost like they"
430.41,"got used to this thing around"
433.38,"their neck and eyes and it's"
437.94,"almost like they couldn't see"
438.96,"and I said why and after a lot"
444.24,"of product they said well we"
448.23,"don't want to lose our tax"
451.47,"exempt status so what does that"
453.33,"have to do with your tax except"
454.89,"status not knowing and it"
457.98,"basically has to do with the"
459.48,"501c3 status that they can't get"
463.95,"involved from the standpoint of"
465.87,"essentially freedom of speech so"
469.65,"you have these powerful people"
471.24,"with a great voice you know that"
475.65,"christianity and everything"
479.85,"we're talking about today has"
481.2,"haven't had a very very tough"
482.4,"time very tough time you know in"
486.36,"Syria when is before the"
488.64,"migration if you were a"
491.43,"Christian in Syria it was"
493.35,"virtually impossible to come"
495.3,"into the United States if you"
498.06,"were a Muslim from Syria it was"
501.96,"one of the easier countries to"
504.93,"be able to find your way into"
506.67,"the United States think of that"
508.17,"just think of what that means"
509.67,"so I didn't know this and I"
513.51,"didn't know about the I know"
515.13,"501c3 but i didn't know that"
517.409,"it played such a big role and"
519.87,"basically i look back into i"
521.519,"said i want to check this out"
523.079,"and you ever get used to"
526.41,"something that's wrong and you"
528.18,"just sort of live with it right"
530.639,"that's why they weren't telling"
531.72,"me because they almost didn't"
533.1,"even know they got so used to"
534.36,"work these smart the smartest"
536.699,"people the most bold people"
539.399,"incredible people they got so"
541.769,"used to it that they almost"
542.85,"didn't even know like what was"
546.569,"wrong but they knew there was"
548.519,"something wrong and I want to"
551.67,"look into and we had a meeting"
553.56,"three months later with a"
554.61,"similar group the same group a"
555.93,"lot of the same people and I"
558.629,"said you know what if by that"
561.629,"time I have done I did really a"
563.37,"lot of work was Lyndon Johnson"
565.709,"right"
567.66,"see they're all not embarrass"
569.04,"was Lyndon Johnson in the"
571.47,"nineteen seventies and they say"
573.54,"he was having a problem with"
575.1,"either one or more churches and"
578.639,"they were really going after and"
580.74,"he wanted to silence the church"
582.36,"and he got there is a powerful"
586.5,"guy smart guy tough tough very"
591.75,"much different from what we have"
593.069,"today I'll tell you that we"
594.3,"don't have tough we need tough"
596.49,"with Isis and all of the"
597.6,"problems we stuff we need to we"
602.79,"need to"
603.769,"and we need smart but we don't"
606.499,"have that today and will"
607.85,"certainly won't have enough"
608.809,"Hillary Clinton gets it will be"
610.22,"four more years of this but it"
612.889,"was very interesting so I had"
615.8,"the meeting and explain to him"
618.889,"that Lyndon Johnson but most of"
620.389,"them know just like a lot of the"
621.499,"folks in the room shaking their"
622.819,"heads that's right Lyndon"
623.989,"Johnson wanting to silence"
625.369,"people that didn't feel so good"
627.799,"about him is in particular one"
629.929,"church they say in houston right"
631.939,"does anybody know that church"
633.259,"one Church in Houston so we'll"
636.649,"figure it out but maybe it was"
638.239,"many churches but he want to"
640.009,"silence and he was powerful and"
641.839,"he got it approved and he"
643.759,"basically silenced the pastors"
647.029,"and ministers and the rabbi's"
651.86,"and the priests and people of"
655.67,"religion and I said wow that's"
659.209,"incredible"
660.35,"and for some reason the church's"
666.199,"the pastor's the evangelicals"
670.91,"didn't do anything about it it's"
673.579,"very strange because I know how"
676.519,"tough you are"
677.569,"I say what happened what"
680.779,"happened right you're smiling"
683.059,"you all know what happened"
684.17,"because when you think of it you"
687.889,"have men and you have women 5050"
692.089,"approximately very powerful"
694.699,"groups men and women now you"
699.019,"have religion and that's not"
702.319,"fifty-fifty so let's it's eighty"
704.269,"percent 75% eighty-two percent"
707.149,"whatever it may be but most"
710.569,"powerful lobby there is and yet"
713.779,"you've been totally silence and"
715.699,"when they told me that we were"
716.779,"in a building in Manhattan and I"
721.129,"said so that means that you have"
725.329,"less power as powerful people as"
730.069,"people that are representing in"
732.439,"some cases thousands of people"
735.39,"on generally sunday that means"
738.72,"that you have less power than"
742.65,"people walking up and down the"
744.03,"street I pointed 30 stories down"
745.62,"and said look see the people"
747.03,"walking up and that means you"
748.2,"have less power than they do"
749.31,"really"
751.26,"and yet you should be far more"
752.52,"powerful and if you look what's"
756.69,"happened to religion if you look"
760.23,"at what's happening to"
761.22,"Christianity and you look at the"
763.86,"number of people going to"
765.3,"churches and the evangelicals"
768.09,"know this also it's not on this"
771.72,"kind of a climb"
773.19,"it's on this kind of a climb"
775.14,"slow and steady in the wrong"
778.02,"direction and a lot of it has to"
780.42,"do with the fact that you've"
783.39,"been silenced"
784.92,"you've been silenced like a"
789.9,"child has been silenced you've"
791.31,"been silenced strong brilliant"
794.13,"great people that want to do the"
796.62,"right thing we're not talking"
798.09,"about bad people talking about"
799.17,"great people that say don't do"
802.29,"that Donald don't do that Donald"
804.45,"don't do that"
805.56,"okay great people and I said you"
812.28,"know I said that i'm going to"
814.59,"take this into my own hands"
815.97,"because I'm good at this is"
816.99,"where pastor Jefferson's right"
818.49,"that's what I'm good at and I"
822.18,"started telling people about it"
825,"because it really had an impact"
825.87,"on where people silence that are"
828.72,"really our finest people and"
832.62,"their powers been taken away"
834.63,"your power has been totally"
835.86,"taken away i mean i don't want"
837.75,"to insult anybody but your power"
839.22,"has been totally taken away they"
841.23,"were so afraid to even mention"
843.03,"the word endorsement as opposed"
846.42,"to saying you like somebody you"
847.77,"should be able to support that"
848.88,"person and go out and stand on"
850.98,"the street corner and say Trump"
853.98,"is the best he's representing us"
856.17,"the best or whoever you want and"
857.82,"I really minute whoever you want"
859.14,"but you can't do that now I know"
861.69,"you're not going to Hillary that"
862.68,"I know anyone"
863.99,"k to tell you folks you got two"
865.82,"choices"
867.41,"you got two choices you've got"
871.399,"two choices and one of your"
873.77,"choice you're not yet i go over"
875.63,"that just so I feel confident I"
879.62,"feel confident but you should be"
881.93,"able to even if you didn't want"
883.58,"that choice you should be able"
884.36,"to go out and stand up and say"
885.77,"that that's the one I want I"
887.149,"want that one and you should"
889.31,"also be able to you know what to"
891.41,"represent have somebody who"
892.91,"represents your your feelings"
896.51,"about life you should have that"
898.37,"person you should be able to"
899.75,"talk about it you can't even"
900.83,"talk about it and that's a"
902.39,"massive thing when you lose your"
903.62,"tax exempt status i mean some of"
905.779,"the churches are you know they"
907.58,"do great work and they can't do"
908.899,"it they can do that"
910.58,"probably half of the money you"
911.81,"take in so i decided to work on"
914.99,"it and I have worked on it and"
916.85,"then I was lucky enough because"
918.77,"of the evangelicals by the way I"
920.27,"was lucky enough to win the"
921.62,"primaries in a landslide that"
923.54,"the highest number of votes in"
925.339,"the history of the Republican"
926.63,"Party think of that and that's"
928.22,"with 17 people that's what 17"
934.64,"people so in the highest number"
936.8,"of votes one you know most of"
938.39,"the states and it was like a"
939.68,"landslide and a lot of that was"
943.73,"because of the evangelicals i'll"
945.2,"never forget we're doing well we"
947.6,"won New Hampshire we won this"
949.1,"one we did great in"
950.149,"Massachusetts we went to South"
952.55,"Carolina and we went to North"
954.89,"Carolina they said well there"
956.99,"he'll have problems because they"
958.67,"have a tremendous number i think"
961.25,"it's sixty percent evangelical"
963.02,"and South Carolina and North"
964.91,"Carolina a lot and I said but"
968.39,"that's a good thing isn't it"
969.74,"they should no no we could you"
971.57,"have some people that are very"
972.709,"good with i said i don't know i"
974.12,"don't think so i think it's a"
975.02,"good thing I turned out to be"
975.92,"right because they voted for"
977.69,"Trump they wanted Trump and"
980.27,"which I appreciate you know"
982.37,"Protestant presbyterian"
984.2,"I have to admit ok"
986.97,"so anyway and First Presbyterian"
989.49,"Church of Jamaica Jamaica New"
992.699,"York and out in Queens you so"
995.97,"anyway and proud of it but but"
999.689,"so I said I'm gonna take this"
1000.86,"into my own hands and i'm going"
1003.319,"to figure a way that we can get"
1006.41,"you back your freedom of speech"
1008.81,"that was taken away you know"
1016.55,"this wasn't this wasn't taken"
1020.75,"away as part of our Constitution"
1022.31,"when are great for fathers one"
1027.049,"out and rotor this was delivered"
1029.36,"in johnson and the nineteen"
1030.709,"seventies"
1031.459,"okay so this isn't something"
1032.809,"that we need great legal"
1035.12,"dialogue on this was Lyndon"
1036.919,"Johnson in the nineteen"
1039.079,"seventies and Lyndon Johnson I"
1041,"respect Lyndon Johnson because"
1042.65,"he was one smart cookie but I"
1044.63,"mean lyndon johnson was a major"
1046.28,"player he was a very very tough"
1049.25,"cookie and he was able to"
1050.99,"silence his critics by doing"
1053,"that so we're gonna get your"
1054.919,"voice back we're gonna get it"
1056.03,"back and when it looked like it"
1058.46,"i was going to win it will look"
1060.14,"for a while but you know we"
1061.19,"still had never dropped never"
1062.57,"truck all these people never"
1064.37,"Trump that's why i love Mike"
1067.01,"because mike said hey still a"
1070.13,"good job and his so in such an"
1074.96,"amazing guy and we always got"
1077.03,"along and somehow we always got"
1079.22,"along and there were a few"
1079.97,"others to whip some pretty good"
1081.53,"relationships but I said you"
1083.539,"know we're gonna do something"
1085.159,"and when I got the nomination"
1086.57,"and as we were getting it we"
1089.87,"were working on the platform i"
1091.49,"said to my people see if you can"
1093.169,"add in the Johnson amendment"
1096.65,"call it the Johnson amendment"
1098.21,"that we're going to get rid of"
1100.01,"the Johnson amendment now"
1103.43,"now I wanted to come and explain"
1111.56,"it because a lot of people don't"
1112.58,"know in the kind of detail and"
1115.82,"depth that I've explained it to"
1117.14,"you today I was a couple of"
1119.09,"pastors to we see and they"
1120.23,"weren't really sure they had"
1121.37,"heard we're going to get it but"
1122.45,"they weren't really sure i hope"
1124.34,"you can spread the word this"
1126.35,"will be so great for religion"
1130.28,"but it would be so great for the"
1132.29,"evangelicals for the pastures"
1133.76,"for the minister's for the"
1135.8,"priests for America for America"
1138.62,"they took away your horse they"
1140,"took away the voice of great"
1142.46,"people they took away the voice"
1144.62,"of people that want to see good"
1147.59,"things happen it's not like they"
1149.54,"took away a bad voice an evil"
1151.7,"voice they took away a voice and"
1155.15,"I mean took it away because when"
1157.16,"you were up if you were to think"
1158.93,"two people in this room where"
1160.16,"they're actually but if you were"
1161.87,"in that room with me they were"
1163.7,"silent they didn't want to get"
1166.34,"involved with good things so"
1169.07,"we're gonna put it together and"
1172.67,"we actually put it in the"
1173.72,"platform and i have to say the"
1176.42,"Republicans were great"
1181.929,"I will get it approached and"
1183.999,"we'll get it out what will be"
1184.99,"able to terminate the Johnson"
1186.309,"amendment and you'll have great"
1188.289,"power to do good things and"
1191.289,"religion will start going"
1192.879,"instead of this way I mean"
1195.429,"Christianity when you think of"
1198.7,"what's happening you look at the"
1199.929,"numbers i talk about sunday"
1201.999,"school people don't even know"
1202.96,"what i'm talking about anymore"
1204.1,"it's true they don't know what"
1205.659,"i'm talking about when you look"
1207.73,"instead of going this way you're"
1208.929,"going to be going this way you"
1209.83,"may be going this weapon you're"
1210.909,"going to be going we're going to"
1212.23,"bring it back because it's a"
1214.36,"good thing it's a good thing"
1216.309,"they treated you like it was a"
1217.539,"bad thing but it's a great thing"
1219.22,"not a good thing it's a great"
1220.6,"thing so if I get elected"
1223.69,"president one of the early"
1226.539,"things one of the absolute first"
1228.19,"things I'm going to do is work"
1230.529,"on totally knocking out the"
1235.6,"Johnson amendment now it's not"
1237.58,"gonna be that hard because even"
1239.74,"the Democrats the power you have"
1241.96,"is so enormous"
1243.249,"it's not like you have you"
1244.779,"represent two percent of the"
1246.19,"country and you know it's going"
1248.59,"to be difficult"
1250.269,"you probably seventy five eighty"
1251.98,"percent and if you want to put"
1255.129,"your full weight i mean can you"
1258.039,"imagine if all of your people"
1259.509,"start calling up the local"
1260.71,"congressman and the local"
1261.94,"senator and you mean they don't"
1265.48,"have a chance of winning that"
1268.149,"one that one and I don't need"
1269.71,"lobbyists like Hillary Clinton"
1271.179,"needs to pay them a fortune by"
1274.179,"the way we don't need lobbyists"
1276.399,"you know the lobbyists they get"
1277.48,"paid a fortune and they have"
1279.519,"total control over Hillary"

1763.549,"you're never going to have this"
1764.509,"chance again you can have one"
1765.859,"chance and the reason i wanted"
1767.509,"to do this instead of a"
1768.71,"whole-home speech where I say"
1770.269,"you know talk about my childhood"
1773.119,"talk about whatever have few"
1776.539,"people yawning in the middle"

1779.809,"teleprompter right i had tell"
1782.809,"know I had a speech written by a"
1787.669,"professional and I said I'm not"
1788.929,"reading this and and you have a"
1798.139,"chance to do something that will"
1800.989,"be earth-shaking I literally"
1804.559,"meaning earth-shaking you've got"
1807.35,"to get your people out to vote"
1808.429,"and especially in those states"
1810.889,"where were represented having a"
1813.35,"tremendous problem in utah utah"
1815.69,"is a different place and not"
1817.309,"over there is anybody here from"
1818.48,"Utah"
1819.859,"I mean it's didn't think so we"
1823.82,"have a problem"
1824.84,"I mean because you know it look"
1827.059,"could coerce the Supreme Court"
1828.83,"going to have four or five"
1830.45,"justices put on having a problem"
1832.309,"it's a false i've been given a"
1834.23,"false narrative but we're doing"
1837.409,"really well in some states"
1839.149,"including Florida how many from"
1840.919,"Florida here lot o"
1843.67,"and look if you get your people"
1848.26,"out to vote with a win Florida"
1850.27,"so we're even maybe one . up one"
1852.67,"point downwards it even and I"
1854.92,"haven't started yet you know I"
1856.12,"really haven't started don't"
1857.32,"forget i won the primaries by a"
1859.75,"landslide and people were"
1864.04,"sitting were really shocked you"
1866.35,"remember the story when we had"
1867.64,"Marco and Jeb and we had like"
1870.34,"you know initially 17 people and"
1874.27,"they so mark on Jeff and they"
1876.52,"said what we'll do"
1877.15,"winner-take-all that way one of"
1878.32,"the two guys will pick up 99"
1879.7,"delegates right and I said I"
1881.83,"don't want that you have a"
1883.39,"governor for eight years and you"
1884.62,"have a senator who is a rising"
1885.94,"star and you have trumpet than"
1889.21,"the first Paul came in and I had"
1890.44,"like forty-eight percent and"
1891.67,"they had 12 and 11 I said I do"
1895.24,"like that now anyway we won by a"
1898.81,"massive amount and it was great"
1900.37,"we need help in Ohio we're very"
1902.8,"close in Ohio I was very close"
1904.81,"but we need help and and the"
1906.37,"fact that you're in florida most"
1907.84,"of your many of you are in"
1908.62,"florida but if you could send"
1910.21,"out the word to ohio"
1911.53,"pennsylvania some of those"
1914.02,"really important swing states"
1915.58,"i'm telling you we will we will"
1919.99,"do it and because we're close"
1921.76,"very close in the role of"
1924.73,"Pennsylvania's a little little"
1926.02,"further up but I think we're"
1927.07,"gonna win Pennsylvania because"
1927.97,"the minor she wants the miners"
1929.35,"out of business you want steel"
1930.61,"out of business and she's I mean"
1933.01,"what she's a disaster"
1934.57,"she suggests i think we're gonna"
1935.95,"win Pennsylvania but if we"
1938.83,"become president we are going to"
1942.25,"do something that will be so"
1944.11,"great for something that we all"
1946.36,"love"
1947.29,"ok something that we all love"
1948.91,"and we have 90 days"
1950.74,"not long you know 90 days when I"
