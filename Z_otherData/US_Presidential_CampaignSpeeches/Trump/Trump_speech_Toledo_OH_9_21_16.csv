1593.009,"those who leave the faith we've"
1595.559,"admitted tens of thousands from"
1598.019,"these countries in the last few"

1640.049,"terrorism she won't say the"
1641.519,"words Hillary Clinton she talks"
1643.799,"tough about my supporters that's"
1646.44,"what she does but she doesn't"

1830.97,"be a fair deal and if it's not"
1832.8,"will terminate and we'll start"
1834.54,"all over again because NAFTA is"

1860.96,"Mexico slaps us with a huge"
1863.72,"value added tax or a backdoor"
1865.91,"tariff but before it moves its"

1875.78,"this but mexico through the back"
1877.94,"will give forward a hefty that"
1880.7,"tax rebate and backdoor export"
1884.21,"subsidy it makes it impossible"
1886.43,"for our country to compete i"
1889.49,"don't know how many people just"
1890.69,"understood what I said does"
1891.83,"anybody understand right because"
1895.1,"it makes it impossible they made"
1898.79,"a mistake when they negotiated"
1900.74,"this deal we have different tax"
1902.33,"systems and Mexico is I mean"
1905.18,"they gotta be left in this going"
1906.59,"on for years"
1907.79,"it makes it impossible for our"
1910.34,"country to compete"
1912.23,"that's why how often do you see"
1913.73,"the factories going the other"
1914.87,"way they'll go the other way"
