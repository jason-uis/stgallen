967.78,"of trade deals for his funds to"
970.57,"have the best schools and the"
971.86,"best jobs you must have safe"
974.47,"communities that means we must"
976.63,"recognize the contributions of"
979.21,"our police who come from all"
981.64,"backgrounds at all walks of life"
983.47,"and who often thanklessly risk"
986.14,"their own lives to protect"
988.51,"innocent people many of whom"
990.85,"they've never met we all"
993.16,"remember earlier this year when"

1009.9,"office risk their lives for"
1012.42,"really complete strangers and in"
1015.57,"every year many of them will go"
1018.48,"out and calls and never returned"
1021.48,"it's tough being a police"
1023.55,"officer and it's hard now even"
1026.31,"recruiting police office so"
1028.44,"tremendous problem"
1029.76,"police are entrusted with"
1032.16,"immense responsibility and we"
1034.74,"must do everything we can to"
1036.51,"ensure that they are properly"
1038.82,"trained that they respect all"
1040.86,"members of the"
1041.85,"public and that any wrongdoing"
1043.77,"is always and it will be by them"
1046.41,"vigorously addressed has to be"
1048.96,"but our men and women in blue"
1051.24,"and you know this"
1053.549,"the men and women in blue need"
1057.299,"your support they need your"
1059.429,"thanks and they need your"
1060.539,"gratitude they are the line"
1063.21,"separating civilians and"
1065.7,"civilization from total chaos"
1069.63,"they're also the front lines of"
1071.28,"defense in the war on terror as"
1074.25,"we saw recently with their quick"
1076.08,"action following the terrorist"
1077.61,"attacks in new jersey and new"
1079.2,"york and the off-duty police"
1081.63,"office"
1082.65,"I mean you saw the heroics of"
1084.51,"the off-duty police officers in"
1087.57,"Minnesota an amazing job they"
1090.45,"did catching this horrible"
1094.11,"person so quickly with how do"
1096.9,"you do that they figured it out"
1098.789,"and within a short period of"
1100.86,"time they were able to capture"
1102.33,"maybe who could do that that's"
1105.09,"tougher that finding oil i will"
1107.1,"tell you right"
1109.5,"in addition to providing safety"
1112.59,"we must provide economic"
1113.94,"opportunity and that begins with"
1116.76,"school choice and leads to a"
1119.25,"secure job with the rising"
1121.62,"income"
1122.61,"this brings us to the subject of"
1126.39,"energy producing more American"
1129.63,"energy is a central part of my"
1131.909,"plan to making America wealthy"
1135.059,"again especially for the poorest"
1137.429,"Americans"
1145.23,"I knew I have to make that"
1147.78,"statement in order to get you"
1149.13,"guys a little bit in life and"
1151.919,"when you like the rest of what"
1154.83,"I'm going to say even more"
1155.91,"American is sitting on a"
1158.07,"treasure trove of untapped"
1160.89,"energy some 50 trillion dollars"
1164.1,"in shell energy oil reserves and"
1166.5,"natural gas on federal lands in"
1168.57,"addition to hundreds of years of"
1171.51,"coal energy reserves it's all"
1174.69,"upside for this country more"
1177.059,"jobs more revenues more wealth"
1180.51,"higher wages and lower energy"
1184.02,"prices i'm going to lift the"
1187.38,"restrictions on American energy"
1189.9,"and allow this wealth to pour"
1192.63,"into our communities including"
1194.61,"right here in the state of"
1197.1,"Pennsylvania that we love"
1204.87,"according to the Institute for"
1208.14,"energy research lifting the"
1210.57,"restrictions on American energy"
1212.4,"including shale production will"
1215.1,"accomplish the following"
1217.17,"increase GTP by more than 100"
1222.33,"billion dollars each year"
1226.14,"that's good music and over 500"
1230.309,"thousand new jobs annually"
1233.58,"increase annual wages by more"
1237.42,"than 30 billion dollars over the"
1239.85,"next seven years increased"
1242.46,"federal state and local tax"
1245.13,"revenues by almost six trillion"
1247.47,"dollars over four decades"
1248.85,"increased total economic"
1251.28,"activity by more than 20"
1253.92,"trillion dollars over the next"
1255.9,"40 years in addition we will"
1259.29,"streamline the permitting"
1260.46,"process which probably makes you"
1262.62,"happier even then when i'm going"
1264.21,"to say we're lowering taxes the"
1266.49,"permitting process in your"
1268.02,"industry is a disaster"
1270.27,"it's a disaster every friend I"
1273.33,"have in your industry they tell"
1275.429,"me it has become horrible with"
1277.98,"EPA so we're going to take care"
1280.32,"of that and all energy"
1282.57,"infrastructure projects"
1283.95,"including the billions of"
1285.66,"dollars in projects held up by"
1287.49,"President Obama billions and"
1289.679,"billions held up creating"
1291.6,"countless more jobs for our"
1294.15,"country in the process overall"
1297.57,"my entire economic plan tax"
1299.85,"reform regulatory reform energy"
1303.54,"reform and trade before will"
1306.21,"create at least 25 million new"
1309.179,"jobs over the next ten years"
1310.74,"assuming an average growth rate"
1313.11,"of three four five percent and I"
1315.929,"believe we can reach beyond"
1318.3,"actually four percent growth"
1320.4,"why not"
1322.919,"and just so you know when China"
1328.259,"does seven percent or even eight"
1329.999,"percent it's a major panic in"
1331.769,"the country they don't start"
1333.48,"devaluing of course and they get"
1335.369,"their numbers up much to our"
1338.19,"chagrin my tax plan includes a"
1341.85,"15-percent business rate think"
1344.85,"of that so that we're reducing"
1347.1,"taxes from 35% all the way down"
1351.119,"for business to fifteen percent"
1353.58,"turning America into a jobs"
1357.269,"magnet Hillary Clinton would"
1360.419,"raise taxes on some small"
1362.369,"businesses as high as forty five"
1364.44,"percent and probably even higher"
1366.69,"than that and as far as"
1368.519,"regulations are concerned it"
1370.799,"will be beyond anything you're"
1373.169,"experiencing right now so you"
1376.379,"better get everybody at the"
1377.58,"world fuck so you can forget it"
1379.83,"and all these jobs that were"
1380.94,"talking about will go in the"
1382.649,"opposite direction income taxes"
1384.779,"will be simplified from seven"
1387.09,"brackets 23 and middle-class"
1389.309,"Americans will get a major tax"
1391.919,"cuts including childcare"
1393.69,"deductions and tax free child"
1396.029,"care savings against my plan"
1399.359,"includes the elimination of all"
1400.83,"unnecessary regulations and a"
1403.23,"temporary moratorium or new"
1405.419,"regulations not compelled by"
1407.759,"Congress or public safety"
1416.29,"over regulation is costing our"
1419.23,"economy two trillion dollars a"
1422.56,"year and I think probably no"
1424.78,"other business has been more"
1426.1,"affected than your business by"
1427.6,"over-regulation and one of the"
1430.39,"things I've seen"
1431.65,"despite this massive tax cut the"
1433.45,"biggest since ronald reagan and"
1435.19,"maybe beyond that from 35 to 15"
1438.4,"people are more excited when I"
1440.26,"talked about the fact that we're"
1441.73,"going to be cutting massively"
1443.71,"regulations we need regulations"
1446.92,"for safety and environment but"
1449.29,"regulations are becoming a major"
1451.21,"industry right now and we're"
1453.61,"going to make it a much smaller"
1455.35,"industry maybe a minor industry"
1457.9,"your regulations are going to be"
1459.67,"cut back to a point that you'll"
1462.64,"be able to have your businesses"
1464.08,"grow your businesses and start"
1465.7,"new businesses and you'll never"
1467.59,"be able to do that with what has"
1469.54,"taken place over the last eight"
1471.7,"years and I just think it's a"
1474.67,"very important thing and what is"
1476.35,"it really impress these people"
1477.43,"have actually people in business"
1478.93,"have actually felt more strongly"
1481.27,"about that even then the tax cut"
1483.07,"itself so i understand that very"
1485.26,"well on energy my economic plan"
1488.53,"unlocks our shell oil and gas"
1491.53,"and the energy technologies of"
1493.9,"both today and tomorrow"
1496.6,"finally my plan includes a"
1498.55,"renegotiation of America's trade"
1502.24,"deals and an enforcement of"
1504.91,"trade rules to increase jobs and"
1507.52,"wealth inside the United States"
1510.1,"we have people right in this"
1511.27,"room that could do so well for"
1515.02,"us we have negotiators of our"
1517.66,"trade deals who are political"
1519.55,"hacks who are people that don't"
1521.62,"know the first thing about"
1522.4,"negotiation of course you can"
1524.74,"just look at the Iran deal and"
1526.06,"you understand that the deal was"
1528.22,"made recently with Iran what a"
1529.96,"deal that is I mean we have half"
1532.18,"of this room could have"
1532.93,"negotiated a deal ten times"
1534.43,"better a lot of the people who"
1535.75,"just wouldn't have made the deal"
1536.809,"all of that would have been a"
1537.499,"lot better but they did"
1544.909,"something that you folks even"
1546.679,"Harold Hamm never so before we"
1549.259,"thought it was 400 million in"
1551.12,"cash cash not like a check four"
1555.2,"hundred million in cash"
1557.509,"it was 1.7 billion in cash and"
1560.24,"even you you've never seen 1.7"
1562.279,"cash read we're talking about"
1564.259,"cash erald man one . that take"
1568.789,"airplane like this airplane I"
1570.44,"don't even see how an airplane"
1571.7,"even a big one is big enough of"
1573.35,"that i would like to see that"
1575.269,"someday 1.7 billion in cash but"
1577.669,"had nothing to do with the"
1578.659,"hostages with strong border"
1581.48,"controls will also protect our"
1583.85,"workers and save our budget"
1585.769,"trillions in the long term it is"
1588.11,"perhaps the most growth economic"
1590.929,"plan anywhere in American"
1594.08,"history i think it is"
1596.179,"compare that to my opponent she"
1598.85,"plans a 1.3 trillion dollar tax"
1601.909,"like massive new regulations and"
1605.24,"some of your industry sitting"
1606.769,"right in this room are out of"
1607.999,"business the offshoring of"
1610.58,"American jobs and the aggressive"
1612.59,"restriction of American energy"
1615.32,"production her plan will help"
1619.07,"only her wealthy donors and"
1621.35,"global special interests who"
1623.179,"benefit from the rig system and"
1626.36,"we are in a root system Hillary"
1628.58,"Clinton wants to put the coal"
1630.23,"miners out of work man hydraulic"
1633.289,"fracking in almost all places"
1635.99,"and extensively restrict and bad"
1638.899,"energy production or public"
1641.149,"lands and in most offshore areas"
1644.269,"which he said remember she said"
1647.539,"we're gonna put the miners at"
1649.07,"work"
1649.759,"this will produce devastation"
1651.919,"four states like Pennsylvania"
1652.85,"Ohio West Virginia and so many"
1656.57,"others where shallow and gel"
1660.169,"energy and call and call"
1663.049,"production are critical parts of"
1666.86,"the economy and I go to the call"
1668.57,"areas"
1669.2,"and it's like devastation and"
1670.669,"these are amazing people"
1671.99,"unbelievable people her plan"
1674.659,"hurt states like Colorado"
1676.159,"Florida Virginia North Carolina"
1679.94,"and anywhere with access to"
1683.12,"either onshore or offshore"
1684.919,"energy resources you also"

1695.419,"marketplace"
1696.559,"according to The Wall Street"
1698.24,"Journal overall more than a"
1700.82,"dozen fossil-fuel projects worth"
1703.7,"about thirty three billion"
1705.289,"dollars have been either"
1706.97,"rejected by regulators or"

1711.38,"2012 only with billions more"
1715.25,"tied up and projects still in"
1718.25,"regulatory limbo they won't"
1720.799,"happen even now our president"
1723.409,"happen quickly i can tell you"
1724.94,"that happened very quickly be"
1730.549,"amazed how quickly they have"
1732.08,"examples of energy"
1733.909,"transportation projects blocked"
1735.889,"or event included 850 million"
1738.919,"dollar coal export facility in"

1755.12,"private infrastructure"
1755.87,"investment have been lost to the"
1758.87,"obama-clinton restriction agenda"
1762.139,"and many many billions more to"
1765.769,"follow the platform produced by"
1768.86,"hillary clinton's party this"
1770.299,"year also calls for a price on"
1773.179,"carbon that's just political"
1776.48,"speak for a massive new tax on"
1779.389,"call and cherrylle production a"
1781.76,"tax on American consumers and"
1785.12,"it's very unfair to our country"
1787.309,"and it makes it very unfair and"
1790.37,"very uncompetitive to do"
1793.039,"business with other countries"
1795.32,"very it makes it so tough to"
1799.82,"compete with other countries"
1802.01,"and remember every energy dollar"
1805.13,"that isn't harvest here in"
1807.35,"America is harvested instead in"
1809.54,"a foreign country often foreign"
1812.03,"countries not very friendly to"
1814.67,"us that not only means so true"
1819.29,"that not only means that we're"
1822.98,"sending our jobs to those"
1824.57,"countries but it means that"
1825.77,"energy is being produced in"
1827.75,"foreign countries that lack are"
1830.09,"high environmental and"
1831.95,"conservation standards which we"
1834.26,"want to keep that is just one"
1836.6,"more reason why we should pursue"
1838.73,"the safe and responsible"
1840.29,"production of America's vast"
1843.41,"energy resources and reserves we"
1847.25,"need an American first energy"
1850.25,"plant it's going to be from now"
1852.53,"on America first"
1860.999,"this means opening federal lands"
1863.909,"for oil and gas production"
1864.959,"opening offshore areas and"
1868.019,"revoking policies that are"
1869.579,"opposing unnecessary"
1871.349,"restrictions on innovative new"

1880.109,"utica shale and i know so well"
1882.599,"I'm up in New York State what a"
1884.909,"shame water shape well-funded"
1887.429,"what you understand it's"
1888.869,"probably one guy from New York"
1890.159,"over there he's barely he's he's"
1893.069,"been trying to get that stuff"
1894.239,"for about 20 years and now his"
1896.579,"clap he's barely making who's"

1914.679,"change the economic landscape of"
1916.929,"this region at our country"
1918.46,"bringing extraordinary new"
1919.9,"prosperity to millions more jobs"
1922.179,"higher wages a larger tax base"
1924.789,"and dollars flowing into our"
1926.83,"country for a change instead of"
1929.62,"out of our country which is"
1930.91,"typical Hillary Clinton's were"
1932.95,"energy will cost our economy"
1934.299,"five trillion dollars at least"
1937.6,"she's not only declared war on"
1939.429,"the minors but on all oil and"
1943,"natural gas production it's war"
1945.58,"which supports 10 million jobs"
1948.61,"in the United States and you"
1949.929,"people know it'swork it's going"
1951.49,"to be worse under her then it's"
1953.559,"been under President Obama"
1955.78,"access to low-cost liquid"
1958.51,"natural gas also supports the"
1960.34,"american chemical industry which"
1962.77,"supports 40,000 jobs in the"
1965.32,"state of Pennsylvania we have"
1967.809,"just begun as a nation to"
1969.82,"recognize our economic advantage"
1972.22,"that is made possible by shell"
1975.52,"energy the shell energy"
1978.28,"revolution will unleash massive"
1980.77,"wealth for American workers and"
1983.2,"their families at the same time"
1985.299,"this energy revolution will"
1987.49,"produce new demand for American"
1990.429,"steel and that means the"
1993.01,"steelworkers will benefit and"
1995.02,"the steelworkers today are"
1996.909,"having a very very hard time"
1999.37,"that business is going down on a"
2002.789,"yearly basis we are going to"
2005.19,"benefit the steelworkers and the"
2006.99,"steel business but federal"
2009.27,"restrictions remain a major"
2010.62,"impediment to both shale"
2012.39,"production specifically and"
2014.82,"energy production in general"
2016.83,"currently less than ten percent"
2018.809,"of the federally managed surface"
2021.09,"and mineral estates are leased"
2023.46,"for oil and gas development"
2025.65,"almost ninety percent of our"
2028.14,"nation's off your acreage is"
2030.059,"off-limits to energy production"
2032.34,"many cases is absolutely no"
2035.52,"reason for that our energy"
2037.89,"policy will make full use of our"
2040.32,"domestic energy"
2041.63,"resources including traditional"
2043.46,"and renewable energy sources we"
2047.36,"want everything that means we"

2056.09,"the coal mining lease moratorium"
2059.149,"which is a horrible moratorium"
