1098.51,"know where she got it she got it"
1100.28,"probably from Bernie who took"
1101.99,"her so far left"
1103.52,"why do you see what she does to"

1148.86,"jameel Shaw Marianne Mendoza"
1151.83,"Sabine durden and Laura"
1154.799,"Wilkerson Hillary Clinton is"
1157.77,"either too corrupt or too"
1159.48,"cowardly to meet with the"
1161.37,"families of those killed by the"
1163.679,"policies she and Obama support"
1170.77,"Hillary Clinton has totally"
1173.17,"forgotten the first rule of"
1176.02,"public service the job of an"
1179.35,"elected official is to serve the"
1182.05,"citizens of the United States"
1184.12,"that's what the job"
1188.419,"and if you don't understand that"
1190.46,"then you are not fit to run for"
1194.69,"the office of President of the"
1196.58,"United States"
1203.83,"if you're not prepared to put"
1206.11,"American workers first then you"
1208.63,"should not hold or seek public"
1211.809,"office"
1212.59,"we're not working for somebody"
1213.97,"else we're not working for"
1215.799,"another country"
1217.24,"it's just that simple no issue"
1220.12,"better illustrates how corrupt"
1222.7,"my opponent is than her"
1224.649,"pay-for-play scandals as"
1227.38,"Secretary of State"
1231.01,"as the evidence has become"
1233.77,"public over the last several"
1235.78,"months i become increasingly"
1238.09,"shocked by the vast scope of"
1241.84,"Hillary Clinton's criminality is"
1243.88,"criminality everybody knows it"
1247.42,"everybody knows our country has"
1250.15,"gone so far behind everybody has"
1253.03,"already learned said she turned"
1256.09,"over all over work-related"
1258.16,"emails sheet"
1272.84,"she testified to Congress under"
1275.929,"penalty of perjury"
1277.52,"now we learn about another"
1278.809,"fifteen thousand emails she"
1281.72,"failed to turn over and they've"
1283.64,"just been discovered i guess"
1285.26,"today"
1289.61,"and don't forget the 33,000"
1293.12,"emails"
1294.17,"she's already deleted colin"
1297.02,"powell just proved again how"
1298.58,"dishonest Hillary Clinton is"
1300.17,"after he busted her for trying"
1302.54,"to pin the email scandal on him"
1304.58,"one more Hillary Clinton lie"
1309.91,"her foundation took in large"
1312.85,"payments from major corporations"
1315.4,"and wealthy individuals foreign"
1318.1,"and domestic"
1319.33,"and all the while she was"
1321.82,"Secretary of State Clinton"
1325.06,"Foundation accepted as much as"
1327.97,"60 million dollars from Middle"
1330.31,"Eastern countries that oppressed"
1332.38,"women gays and people of"
1335.2,"different face the foundation"
1340.36,"donors include corporations and"
1342.97,"individuals with significant"
1345.25,"matters before the State"
1347.71,"Department not good and then"
1350.89,"either Hillary Clinton herself"
1352.84,"or one of her closest aides took"
1355.96,"action favorable to these donors"
1358.78,"her actions corrupted and"
1362.35,"disgraced one of the most"
1364.21,"important departments of"
1365.53,"government indeed one of only"
1367.66,"four established by the United"
1370.27,"States Constitution itself the"
1373.87,"Clintons made this state"
1375.85,"department into the same kind of"
1378.4,"pay for play operation as the"
1381.1,"Arkansas government was now"
1383.5,"think of what happened back then"
1385.54,"think about it and i love the"
1389.02,"state of Arkansas we're winning"
1390.67,"it big but i'll tell you they"
1392.02,"know what went on they know and"
1394.36,"they're not happy pay the"
1396.49,"Clinton Foundation huge sums of"
1398.56,"money and throwing some big"
1400.12,"speaking fees for Bill Clinton"
1401.44,"and you got the play"
1404.38,"you got to do what you wanted to"
1406.33,"do it's pretty said this is in"
1409.87,"front of the State Department"
1411.43,"this is in front of the State"
1413.95,"Department and long before that"
1416.14,"you should have seen what they"
1417.34,"were doing in Arkansas same old"
1420.37,"story folks the amounts involved"
1423.07,"the favors done and the"
1426.01,"significant number of times it"
1428.17,"was done require an expedited"
1431.74,"investigation by a special"
1434.17,"prosecutor immediately"
1436.27,"immediately"
1437.25,"immediately"
1444.999,"after the FBI or Department of"
1447.279,"Justice whitewashed Hillary"
1449.769,"Clinton's email crimes they"
1451.839,"certainly cannot be trusted to"
1453.669,"quickly or partially investigate"
1456.159,"Hillary Clinton's new crimes"
1459.009,"which happened all the time"
1463.359,"some former prosecutors have"
1466.059,"even suggested that the"
1468.039,"coordination between the pay for"
1470.259,"play State Department and the"
1472.479,"Clinton Foundation constant to a"
1475.539,"clear example of Rico"
1477.609,"racketeering influenced corrupt"
1480.309,"organization and surprise the"
1483.789,"Justice Department is required"
1486.039,"to appoint an independent"
1487.479,"special prosecutor because it"
1490.539,"has proven itself to be really"
1493.179,"sadly a political arm of the"
1496.599,"White House nobody has ever seen"
1500.529,"anything like this before the"
1505.479,"Department of Justice has acted"
1508.329,"very unethically particularly"
1511.029,"the Attorney General's private"
1512.979,"lengthy 39 minute meeting in the"
1516.099,"back of an airplane before the"
1518.949,"department's decision"
1521.96,"not to prosecute her for crimes"
1524.51,"that would have been prosecuted"
