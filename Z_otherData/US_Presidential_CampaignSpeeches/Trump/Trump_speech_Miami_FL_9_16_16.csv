809.829,"with her statements last week"
812.17,"working people who just want a"
815.079,"fraction of the security enjoyed"
818.29,"by our politicians and certainly"
821.44,"enjoyed by her"
823.27,"now you know she's very much"
824.8,"against the Second Amendment she"
826.81,"wants to destroy your second"
828.34,"Amendment"
831.39,"guns guns guns right i think"
835.08,"what we should do is she goes"
838.02,"around with armed bodyguards"
840.93,"like you have never seen before"
842.04,"I think that her bodyguards she"
845.67,"drop all weapons face it this"
847.68,"arm right right i think they"

853.29,"do you think yes take their guns"
857.49,"away she doesn't want guns take"
860.25,"their let's see what happens to"
861.6,"take their guns away"
864.12,"ok will be very dangerous"
868.44,"her comments displayed the same"
871.14,"sense of arrogance and"
872.73,"entitlement that led her to"
875.19,"violate federal laws Secretary"
877.05,"of State hide and delete her"
878.97,"emails destroyer iphones with a"
881.76,"hammer with a hammer 13 of them"

892.35,"the reach of our enemies lie to"
893.88,"Congress and self-government"
895.92,"favors and access through her"
899.1,"foundation it's the same"
901.65,"attitude of arrogance and"
903.69,"entitlement that explains why"
906.27,"she has never taken"
907.68,"accountability for the disaster"
910.35,"she created in Libya Syria Iraq"
913.44,"Iran and all over the world"
917.07,"everything she touched it just"
919.56,"didn't work out"
920.73,"certainly it didn't work out for"
922.77,"our country"
923.79,"it's the same reason why she"
926.31,"won't take responsibility for"
928.74,"her central role in unleashing"
931.41,"Isis all over the world"
936.6,"her policies have created"

1427.05,"they are being destroyed and"
1432.36,"we're unable to compete with"
1433.95,"other nations very simple and"
1436.38,"that's just the beginning also"
1438.06,"on my first day i'm going to ask"
1441.06,"Congress to send me a bill to"
1442.98,"immediately repeal and replace"
1444.9,"disasters Obamacare it has"

1604.66,"reads that ties us up and bind"
1608.77,"just down and doesn't even"
1610.93,"discuss monetary manipulation"
1613.63,"and evaluation which is how"
1616.87,"China and all these countries"
1618.91,"are beating us so badly not even"
1622.51,"discussed and they had"
1624.25,"provisions in the agreement and"
1628.21,"they were taken out because"
1630.01,"certain politicians didn't want"
1632.05,"to have them in there"
1633.31,"I wonder why another major"
1636.46,"reform is going to be school"
1639.55,"choice"

1669.029,"poor african-american and"
1670.59,"hispanic children out of poverty"
1672.45,"something we are going to do"
1674.309,"since president obama came into"

1777.41,"and frankly when they spend"
1779.84,"hundreds of millions of dollars"
1780.83,"on advertising I don't have to"
1782.99,"because i do it the"
1783.95,"old-fashioned way I come into"
1785.36,"your neighborhood but a lot"
1787.58,"cheaper it's a lot harder work"
1789.68,"but it's a lot cheaper"
