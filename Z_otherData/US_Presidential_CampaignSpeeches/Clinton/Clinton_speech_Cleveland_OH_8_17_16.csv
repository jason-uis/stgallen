77.55,"I always loved being here and"
82.44,"today is particularly special"
84.42,"because I got a tour of this"
86.19,"high school and I first of all"
90.69,"want to thank the people of"
91.98,"cleveland for investing in a"
94.35,"high school that is really all"
95.82,"about the future what what a"
100.62,"stark contrast this high school"
104.19,"poses to what happened here in"
107.52,"cleveland during the republican"
109.11,"convention because honestly they"
112.23,"painted such a bleak negative"
115.29,"picture of america i couldn't"
119.16,"recognize our country listening"
121.89,"to their angry speeches the kind"
126.51,"of negative view that they had"
128.88,"of our people"
130.679,"Donald Trump saying we never win"
133.95,"anymore"
134.91,"well tell that to the Cavaliers"
146.12,"tell that to our Olympic athlete"
150.5,"you are cleaning up in Rio there"
156.62,"is nothing we can't do if we put"
158.72,"our minds to it and that's how I"
161.09,"want America to feel about"
162.59,"itself and how I want every"
164.209,"American to feel and I saw the"
167.239,"future"
168.23,"the students and teachers who"
169.819,"showed me what they're doing"
171.379,"here in robotics in 3d design"
175.94,"and laser design an"
178.37,"entrepreneurial and civic"
180.319,"education I for one am really"
183.17,"proud of this high school and"
185.66,"what it represents for the"
187.489,"students hair and why is that so"
193.519,"important for those of us who"
195.019,"are no longer in high school"
196.459,"because we've got to get the"
200.569,"economy working for everybody"
202.489,"not just those at the top and"
205.459,"how are we going to do that well"
207.65,"I know that too many families"
209.51,"right here in Ohio are feeling a"
212.329,"lot of financial stress worrying"
215.78,"about how they're going to make"
218.389,"ends meet"
219.68,"dealing with all the costs from"
221.299,"childcare to prescription drugs"
223.04,"i understand that that's why I"
226.04,"have laid out specific plans"
228.29,"about how we're going to get the"
229.43,"economy working for everyone and"
232.22,"I think it's important when"
233.81,"someone comes to you and asks"
235.28,"for your support"
237.379,"running for president that maybe"
239.51,"they tell you what they want to"
240.859,"do so that you can decide who"
243.41,"you want to vote for"
246.47,"and sometimes you know I get"
253.25,"criticized for doing that people"
255.59,"say oh there she goes she has"
258.62,"another plan"
260.239,"well i do i've got an"
262.67,"infrastructure plan to create"
263.99,"millions of jobs fixing our"
265.55,"roads our bridges or tunnels our"
267.35,"ports our airports our water"
269,"systems are so our systems as"
274.13,"part of that plan i want to"
275.66,"start a national infrastructure"
277.28,"bank so that we have public and"
279.26,"private funds working together"
280.64,"so we don't just wait on"
282.29,"Congress to act but we are"
284.15,"building rebuilding maintaining"
286.67,"all the time and it's not just"
289.19,"what we can see as important as"
291.08,"that is we need a new modern"
293.75,"electric grid that can take and"
297.05,"distribute clean renewable"
298.37,"energy across America and we"
307.37,"need to finally finish the job"
309.86,"of connecting every home and"
311.84,"business everywhere in America"
313.82,"from inner cities to remote"
316.49,"rural areas to high-speed"
318.62,"broadband access so they can be"
321.77,"part of the 21st century digital"
324.47,"economy you know I was talking"
331.61,"to a group of my friends who are"
333.62,"teachers I love teachers thank"
335.479,"you all for being here with me"
336.919,"and they were telling me they're"
340.31,"just been a national survey done"
342.32,"and the teachers were asked you"
344.69,"ever you know you ever assigned"
347,"homework that requires your"
348.44,"students to go on the internet"
349.55,"and the answer was seventy"
350.9,"percent yes they did"
352.55,"now that makes perfect sense if"
354.2,"you just saw what I saw you"
357.229,"gotta have knowledge of the"
359.72,"internet"
360.919,"you've got to be able to learn"
362.419,"to use it it can spark your"
364.7,"imagination create new dreams i"
367.52,"met young people i said what got"
369.11,"you interested in computer"
370.91,"design 3d design robots"
374.18,"well they were interested in the"
376.28,"arts they were interested in"
378.289,"what they could do"
379.35,"to design and make things so the"
383.85,"answer was seventy percent of"
385.2,"teachers but here's the problem"
386.16,"5 million students five million"
388.68,"homes with students in them in"
391.23,"America do not have access to"
394.47,"the internet and so we're"
397.35,"already creating a big gap a"
401.01,"homework gap which turns into an"
402.78,"achievement gap and doesn't give"
405.72,"every kid the chance to go as"
407.46,"far as his or her hard work and"
409.53,"talent will take them so when I"
412.35,"talk about infrastructure i'm"
414.3,"talking about making our economy"
416.85,"more competitive and creating"
419.1,"more opportunities for more"
420.54,"Americans willing to work for it"
422.04,"because i believe in the basic"
423.27,"bargain if you're willing to"
425.49,"work"
426.45,"you ought to be able to get"
427.56,"ahead and stay ahead that's how"
429,"I was raised"
430.2,"that's what I want Americans to"
431.88,"believe again you know this past"
439.2,"monday i was in Scranton"
440.7,"Pennsylvania with joe biden and"
443.55,"Joe was born and Scranton my"
449.7,"grandparents my father was born"
451.53,"in scranton i went back to"
453.87,"Scranton every summer lot of"
456.57,"Christmas holidays"
458.16,"my grandfather was an immigrant"
460.29,"came as a young child he worked"
463.2,"in the Scranton lace factory"
465.42,"making lace which was a big deal"
468.66,"back in those days i remember we"
470.64,"used to have lace curtains and"
472.02,"lace tablecloths and things like"
473.67,"that and my grandfather worked"
476.85,"really hard because he believed"
478.47,"if he worked hard he could"
479.64,"provide a better life for his"
481.38,"kids and he did my dad got to go"
484.35,"to college she went to Penn"
485.94,"State we played football and"
488.92,"then he took a job in the"
492.97,"Midwest as a salesman and then"
494.95,"went into the Navy during World"
496.51,"War two when he came out he"
497.8,"started a small business and he"
499.48,"worked really hard and I used to"
502,"go help him sometimes because he"
504.31,"printed fabric for draperies and"
507.61,"he had a print plant and he had"
509.23,"two long tables and it was you"
512.38,"know not of it was just a old"
514.18,"plant it was no low ceiling no"
516.52,"windows and he would print that"
519.4,"drapery fabric you take an"
520.81,"old-fashioned silkscreen and he"
522.76,"put it down and pour the paint"
524.35,"in then take a squeegee and then"
526.57,"go from one side of the other"
528.13,"pick up the screen keep going"
529.66,"down the table and he provided a"
532.54,"good life"
533.8,"I grew up in a suburb of Chicago"
536.38,"and so I I know what the"
541.18,"American Dream is all about"
542.83,"I am proud to be the"
543.88,"granddaughter of a factory"
545.08,"worker and the daughter of a"
546.31,"small businessman and standing"
548.14,"here before you"
554.339,"and so when I think about how"
558.749,"hard my dad worked and I think"
561.36,"about imprinting those fabrics"
563.49,"and then loading them into his"
564.87,"car and delivering them to ever"
566.61,"ordered them and then expecting"
569.91,"to be paid because he had done"
572.069,"the work it just really hits me"
575.55,"personally when people are"
579.18,"standing up and telling their"
580.439,"stories they were small business"
582.12,"people they were plumbers"
583.17,"electricians painters who did"
585.449,"work for Donald Trump and he"
586.98,"refused to pay them that"
590.339,"violates the basic bargain if"
592.92,"you do your job you're supposed"
594.749,"to be rewarded for your work not"
597.209,"stiffed not told to go so"
600.059,"somebody and I i can't help but"
605.79,"take it personally because I"
606.959,"think about what would have"
607.949,"happened to my family if my"
610.259,"father had taken a job like that"
613.41,"and put his heart and soul into"
615.209,"it bought the material bought"
617.129,"the paint did the labor shows up"
620.1,"delivers the product and is told"
622.41,"we're not paying you but person"
624.749,"after person small business"
626.339,"after small business is telling"
628.29,"the same story that they were"
630.809,"not paid they were told to go"
632.85,"soo Donald Trump well you're a"
636.209,"small business you can't afford"
637.62,"lawyers to go sue somebody"
639.059,"that's not the way it's supposed"
640.8,"to work"
642.089,"so when I talk about creating"
644.16,"new jobs in infrastructure"
646.679,"advanced manufacturing clean"
648.929,"renewable energy i also talked"
651.12,"about creating more small"
652.709,"businesses and small businesses"
655.079,"that will actually grow and give"
658.23,"more people a chance to fulfill"
660.389,"their dreams and will be part of"
663.149,"the basic bargain who will be"
664.92,"pay for the work that they do so"
667.559,"they can stay"
668.71,"in business now I gotta tell you"
675.37,"creating the jobs of the future"
676.72,"means we've got to make sure"
678.19,"that all Americans not just"
679.63,"young Americans have all the"
681.58,"education and all the skills"
683.2,"that are needed that's why I"
685.03,"want to start with early"
686.2,"childhood education so that more"
687.85,"young kids get prepared to"
690.34,"succeed in school I want to see"
695.11,"more technical education like"
697.06,"ice all right here and john"
698.53,"marshall across America so that"
700.75,"high school students can be"
703.24,"better prepared you know when we"
705.58,"stopped doing vocational"
707.05,"education some years ago we"
709.3,"basically sent a message to so"
711.28,"many young people there's only"
712.99,"one way to be successful in"
714.55,"America you got to go to a"
715.54,"four-year college that is so"
718.24,"unfair and it's also untrue"
720.73,"actually if you look at job"
726.07,"projections more than half of"
728.35,"the jobs that will be available"
729.73,"in America in 2020 will not"
733.33,"require a four-year college"
734.95,"degree and so how are we going"
737.77,"to get our people prepared"
740.11,"we're going to bring more"
740.95,"technical education not the"
742.96,"old-fashioned kind but what I"
745,"saw here at John Marshall we're"
747.22,"going to bring computer coding"
749.38,"like I saw in a classroom just a"
751.96,"few minutes ago"
753.94,"we're going to bring engineering"
756.25,"and design work we're going to"
758.65,"give young kids in high school"
760.45,"the chance to either get that"
763.21,"education right in their own"
765.01,"school or go to a community"
766.72,"college that will provide it and"
768.76,"give them credit to get a"
770.2,"credential and associate degree"
772.03,"or credit to go on to a"
773.59,"four-year college so we're going"
775.48,"to do more on apprenticeship"
777.01,"programs"
781.56,"I want everybody who's willing"
785.76,"to work to be prepared"
787.98,"I don't want any excuses i'm a"
790.02,"kind of no excuse person if you"
792.66,"are willing to do the work i"
794.31,"want to make sure that we've got"
795.63,"an economy that will produce the"
797.16,"jobs and then I want to make"
799.11,"four-year college affordable if"
801.75,"you go to a four-year public"
803.31,"college or university it should"
806.67,"be affordable and we're going to"
809.64,"make Community College free for"
811.5,"everybody that wants to go to"
814.14,"Community College and we're"
817.02,"going to help everybody was"
818.43,"student debt pay down the debt"
820.35,"get it off their backs now i"
825.21,"think it's i think it's fair to"
826.56,"say okay well how are you gonna"
828.089,"do all that"
828.9,"that's fair to ask well we're"
831.66,"going to do it in two ways"
832.529,"number one we are going to tax"
836.97,"the wealthy who have made all of"
839.55,"the income gains in the last 15"
842.43,"years"
847.649,"the super wealthy corporations"
851.49,"wall street they're going to"
853.709,"have to invest in education in"
856.439,"skills training in"
858.059,"infrastructure because we have"
861.3,"to grow this economy we do need"
863.55,"to have the resources to do that"
865.589,"and I've laid out what i want to"
868.47,"do and how I would do it closing"
870.089,"the loopholes creating a fairer"
872.61,"tax system but I've made very"
874.319,"clear i'm the only candidate who"
875.819,"ran in either the democratic or"
877.41,"republican primary who said from"
879.839,"the very beginning I will not"
881.999,"raise taxes on the middle class"
883.529,"the middle class has to catch up"
886.139,"to where they were before the"
888.66,"great recession and so I've laid"
895.499,"this all out and so independent"
897.689,"analysts economist and others"
900.42,"are looking at what I've said"
901.679,"and what Donald Trump is said"
903.72,"and in fact according to an"
905.22,"independent analysis by Moody's"
908.339,"Analytics carried out by the man"
910.499,"who was John McCain's economic"
912.48,"advisor if you were to implement"
915.509,"what I am proposing we would"
917.279,"create at least 10 million new"
919.499,"jobs in the first term of my"
922.589,"administration by contrast if"
930.149,"you look at what Trump is"
931.47,"proposing and how he wants to"
933.66,"give huge tax breaks to people"
935.639,"who are wealthy like him it"
937.98,"would cost our economy 3.4"
940.05,"million jobs now this is not me"
942.209,"saying it"
943.319,"this is an independent analysis"
945.99,"saying it that has tried to look"
947.429,"at both of us very objectively"
949.86,"but what does that mean for Ohio"
951.839,"if we divide across the country"
954.149,"by population Ohio would gain"
957.6,"376 thousand jobs under my plans"
962.249,"and lose more than a hundred and"
963.809,"twenty-three thousand jobs under"
965.97,"Donald Trump's plans"
967.62,"and it's hard it's not hard to"
974.58,"see why because he wants to give"
976.47,"tax cuts to big corporations"
979.11,"millionaires wall street money"
981.24,"managers he's even created a new"
983.67,"tax loophole that we call the"
985.95,"Trump loophole because it's"
989.37,"really good for Trump it would"
991.74,"let millionaires and"
992.73,"billionaires cut their tax rate"
995.31,"in half on a lot of their income"
997.86,"under his plans Donald Trump"
1001.339,"would pay lower tax rate than"
1003.38,"middle-class families of course"
1004.88,"we have no idea what tax rate he"
1006.77,"pays because unlike everybody"
1009.14,"else who's run for president in"
1010.79,"the last four or five decades he"
1013.16,"refuses to release his tax"
1015.14,"return so the American people"
1017.48,"can't really judge and then"
1024.8,"there's the estate tax which he"
1026.54,"wants to eliminate all together"
1028.1,"so if you believe Donald Trump"
1030.679,"is as wealthy as he claims"
1032.839,"we can't say that for sure but"
1035.24,"let's assume it he would by"
1038.329,"eliminating the estate tax save"
1040.25,"the Trump family four billion"
1042.86,"dollars and do absolutely"
1046.699,"nothing for 99.8 percent of all"
1052.16,"americans now think of what we"
1054.29,"could do with four billion"
1056.179,"dollars in ohio we could build"
1057.65,"280 new elementary schools we"
1061.7,"could eliminate the outstanding"
1063.38,"student loan of a hundred and"
1065.09,"sixty-six thousand Ohioans we"
1070.13,"could provide healthcare to"
1072.38,"370,000 veterans"
1076.429,"and we could sure rebuild every"
1081.529,"crumbling bridge in this state"
1083.33,"and fix a lot of the highways"
1084.95,"that are causing folks that"
1086.57,"incur expenses Donald Trump"
1091.789,"doesn't need a tax cut"
1093.2,"I don't need a tax cut it's time"
1095.57,"for the wealthiest Americans"
1097.249,"whoever you are as well as"
1099.799,"corporations and Wall Street to"
1101.84,"pay your fair share in taxes you"
1104.149,"have been successful in this"
1106.85,"country because of everything"
1110.269,"this country represents we're"
1112.999,"going to stop giving tax breaks"
1114.379,"to corporations that outsource"
1116.509,"jobs and profits we're going to"
1118.549,"reward those who invest in their"
1120.769,"employees again if corporations"
1123.32,"move their headquarters overseas"
1124.97,"we're going to slap an exit tax"
1127.61,"on them and try to persuade them"
1129.35,"not to move we're going to add a"
1134.809,"new tax on multi-millionaires"
1136.85,"crack down on tax gaming and"
1138.769,"close loopholes and then use"
1140.48,"that money to make the kind of"
1144.049,"investments that will grow the"
1145.909,"economy for everybody so here"
1148.429,"here's the bottom line"
1150.11,"there are just 83 days left in"
1152.899,"this election i keep track of"
1155.33,"them"
1155.99,"Austin"
1159.7,"and for anyone waiting for"
1163.45,"Donald Trump to suddenly become"
1165.19,"more responsible remember what a"
1170.38,"great American Maya Angelou said"
1172.45,"when someone shows you who they"
1175.48,"are believe them"
1184.95,"and I I think it's fair to say"

1191.94,"anybody wants from his campaign"
1195.03,"they can make him read new words"
1198.96,"from a teleprompter but he is"
1203.43,"still the same man who insults"
1206.67,"gold star families demeans women"
1209.91,"mocks people with disabilities"
1213.03,"and thinks he knows more about"

1280.45,"issues not insults that's what"
1282.46,"I'm going to continue to do for"
1284.049,"the next 83 days because i think"
1290.53,"the details actually matter"
1292.57,"that's why I sweat the details"
1294.07,"you know I I really care a lot"
1297.4,"about what happens to the young"
1300.429,"people and the families and our"
1302.11,"seniors that's why I'm gonna do"
1305.08,"everything I can to raise the"
1306.73,"national minimum wage so that it"
1308.77,"is a living way I'm going to do"

1318.82,"that you have the healthcare you"
1321.669,"need at an affordable price and"
1324.1,"get the cost of prescription"
1328.03,"drugs down because they are once"
1331.45,"again getting out of reach i was"
1334.39,"at an event the other day and a"
1335.98,"very distinguished doctor the"
1337.75,"head of a big Hospital in New"

1343.51,"drug costs this is not a is not"
1345.909,"of a patient or a family this is"
1347.74,"one of the most distinguished"
1349.15,"doctors in New York City he said"
1352.48,"I it's getting to the point"
1353.409,"where i can't prescribe certain"
1356.5,"drugs at my patients need"
1358.15,"because the insurance won't pay"
1359.53,"for them"
1360.61,"medicare medicaid nobody will"

1363.73,"too expensive and he mentioned"
1366.909,"particularly a drug Buy gilja"
1368.799,"that will cure hepatitis C and"
1372.37,"it is so expensive that a lot of"
1375.61,"Americans are being left out and"
1378.159,"you know what really is"
1379.15,"upsetting about this is that"

1382.63,"drug all over the world at a"
1384.52,"much lower priced everybody else"
1386.409,"now I'm proud i'm proud that our"
