270.86,"choice so right now we're up and"
274.37,"running"
275.06,"we're organizing across America"
277.13,"and as Jordan said this election"
280.94,"has such high stakes but the"
285.11,"highest stakes are for young"
286.25,"people young people across"
289.82,"America this election is going"
293.03,"to determine in so many ways"
295.52,"what kind of futures you will"
298.039,"have I don't say that lightly"
300.62,"everybody always says every"
303.289,"election is important i happen"
304.55,"to believe that I think it's one"
305.78,"of the great gifts of our"
307.849,"democracy that we have the"
310.52,"opportunity to choose our"
311.9,"leaders and people brave people"
316.55,"going back for so many years"
319.55,"have fought to preserve that"
321.44,"right and that right is under"
324.229,"attack right now"
326.76,"and it is under attack in North"
329.94,"Carolina of all places a state"
333.3,"that often set the standard for"
337.11,"moving everybody into the future"
339.27,"and I admired that so much"
342.66,"emphasis on education from"
345.33,"literally preschool through"
347.22,"college emphasis on research"
349.08,"emphasis on job creation and"
352.14,"innovation and now North"
355.68,"Carolina under the current"
358.02,"governor and legislature has"
359.97,"been trying to restrict people's"
362.1,"right to vote"
363.81,"well you know it"
368.43,"north carolina voters though one"
369.99,"important victory when a federal"
372,"court just struck down this"
373.65,"state's voter ID law"
378.9,"and the federal court brought"
380.729,"back more days of what's called"
382.65,"one-stop early voting and here's"
386.1,"what the court said this is not"
387.539,"me talking this is what the"
389.13,"federal court said the court"
391.289,"said the North Carolina law was"
394.05,"designed to target"
395.669,"african-americans with almost"
398.43,"surgical precision"
400.889,"now that's not just happening in"
403.44,"North Carolina unfortunately"
404.94,"it's happening across America"
406.38,"and courts have been overturning"
410.88,"restrictions that make it harder"
412.68,"not just for african-americans"
414.33,"but low-income people Latinos"
417.389,"young people one of the"
419.97,"provisions in the North Carolina"
422.729,"law was to make it really hard"
424.41,"to vote where you go to school"
426.84,"so this has been a concerted"
429.75,"effort to undermine the right to"
432.87,"vote even to make it hard for"
434.4,"people with disabilities to cast"
437.52,"ballots well what's the best way"
440.37,"to repudiate that kind of"
443.07,"underhanded mean spirited effort"
446.22,"to deprive people of their votes"
448.38,"get out and vote and make it"
450.84,"Claire we're not putting up with"
453.06,"that"
455.34,"these laws are a blast from the"
459.72,"jump Jim Crow past and they have"
461.58,"no place in 21st century America"
464.88,"we should be doing everything we"
469.62,"can to make it easier to vote"
471.51,"not harder"
472.979,"that's why if I'm elected"
474.449,"president I will work to expand"
477.18,"early voting we will enact"
479.669,"universal voter registration so"
482.25,"every young person in every"
483.87,"state is automatically"
486.21,"registered to vote when you turn"
488.07,"18"
493.49,"and we will repair the damage"
496.97,"done to the voting rights act"
498.62,"and take on discrimination in"
500.449,"all forms now"
502.819,"hp2 is another example of trying"
506.06,"to discriminate against people"
508.28,"that doesn't have any place in"
511.34,"our modern society"
514.49,"you've seen this firsthand in"
516.08,"North Carolina discrimination is"
517.94,"not only wrong it's bad for"
520.37,"business"
522.08,"the NBA you know cancel the game"
524.87,"paypal cancel brand like 400"
529.279,"jobs others are not coming to"
530.839,"this beautiful state because"
533.36,"they don't want to be associated"
534.47,"with the discriminatory bigoted"
537.23,"policies of your governor and"
539.029,"legislature now one thing you"
543.2,"can do about that is change your"
545.06,"governor in November"
552.13,"and while you're at it change"
554.62,"one of your Senators"
560.37,"we're gonna need reinforcements"
562.2,"up in Washington we got a big"
565.14,"agenda and you know people say"
567.66,"to me well what is it you're"
569.43,"gonna try to get done well i'll"
570.69,"show you real easy we just"
572.25,"published a book right"
578.1,"tim kaine and i put this book"
580.14,"out it's called stronger"
581.61,"together it's not very long"
585.93,"not a hard read but we have this"
588.93,"old-fashioned idea that if we're"
591,"asking you to support us for"
592.47,"president we have to tell you"
593.61,"what we're going to do not just"
598.86,"bluster not just empty words not"
603.24,"just demagogic rhetoric real"
606.39,"plans that will improve your"
608.19,"lives make our country safer and"
611.43,"better so you can pick this up"
614.97,"we're going to build an economy"
615.9,"works for everyone not just"
617.52,"those at the top sounds like a"
618.93,"good idea we're going to make"
620.67,"the biggest investment in"
621.93,"good-paying job since world war"
623.43,"two infrastructure advanced"
627.3,"manufacturing clean energy jobs"
634.18,"we're gonna make the economy"
635.71,"fairer raise the national"
639.04,"minimum wage get people to work"
640.6,"full-time out of poverty and we"
644.529,"are finally going to guarantee"
645.85,"equal pay for women's work it is"
647.83,"long overdue"
654.38,"did you see any of the"
656.12,"Democratic convention"
658.61,"well I don't know you you might"
660.11,"have missed one of my favorite"
661.67,"sets of speakers we had these"
664.28,"two young people from Kansas 17"
667.64,"years old young man young woman"
669.41,"I read about this and I said"
672.86,"let's contact these young people"
674.06,"and find out their story here's"
675.68,"their story 17 had the same"
679.52,"summer job knew each other"
681.98,"working in a pizza restaurant"
683.39,"they were pretty excited i"
685.19,"remember when i got my first"
686.48,"real job not babysitting but you"
689.06,"know actually showing up at a"
690.2,"job and having to do it on and"
694.1,"so what day after they finished"
695.84,"work they were talking and the"
697.16,"young woman said you know I"
698.54,"think make it eight dollars an"
700.16,"hour i should be able to at"
701.18,"least save something for college"
702.77,"and the young man a friend of"
705.05,"her said well I'm making eight"
707.42,"dollars in fifteen cents an hour"
709.04,"and she said well why are you"
712.76,"making 15 cents more an hour"
714.35,"than I am neither of us had any"
716.42,"experience to do this job we're"
718.1,"the same age he said I don't"
720.26,"know that doesn't sound right"
721.7,"maybe there was a mistake so"
724.43,"they go to the manager they tell"
726.92,"the manager and the manager"
728.6,"fired them both and you know"
733.49,"what that's legal"
734.81,"if you find out you're not being"
737.3,"paid the same for doing the same"
740.48,"job you can be fired"
743.57,"so it's not some made-up problem"
747.8,"and this would raise family"
749.87,"incomes and if you have a mother"
751.13,"a wife a daughter or sister"
753.02,"who's working it's your issue so"
754.73,"we're going to get that done as"
755.9,"well"
758.96,"and like I said we're gonna make"
761.63,"college affordable for everybody"
763.43,"pay down debt but we're gonna do"
765.47,"something else I think it was a"
766.94,"mistake when we got rid of all"
769.1,"vocational education in high"
770.69,"school it needed to be improved"
774.56,"don't get me wrong it wasn't"
776.66,"training people for the jobs"
778.19,"that were out in the marketplace"
779.33,"anymore but we got rid of all of"
781.28,"it"
782.42,"we need technical education in"
784.28,"high school we need more"
786.17,"apprenticeship programs where"
788.09,"young people can learn and earn"
790.13,"at the same time"
794.88,"and we're going to go back to"
796.02,"emphasizing that in high school"
797.67,"community colleges"
798.9,"apprenticeship programs creative"
801,"ideas like coding camps we're"
802.86,"going to have 1.4 million jobs"
805.35,"in 2024 people who have computer"
807.39,"science skills and we're going"
809.37,"to only if we continue on our"
811.05,"present path only have 400,000"
813.48,"Americans prepared to do those"
814.68,"jobs i want those jobs to be"
817.11,"American jobs so we're going to"
818.46,"help train people of all ages to"
820.92,"be able to do those jobs we are"
825.27,"also going to defend quality"
828.42,"affordable health care for"
829.35,"everybody but we're gonna get"
830.37,"the cost down we're going to get"
832.98,"the cost of prescription drugs"
834.54,"down for sure and we're going to"
838.26,"emphasize two things that we"
839.82,"have fallen short on Mental"
842.13,"Health and Addiction Services"
843.42,"people I've met here in North"
849.18,"Carolina and across America talk"
850.92,"to me about that all the time so"
852.93,"again we've got our ideas in"
856.8,"here we want you to engage with"
858.69,"us give us your ideas"
860.79,"this needs to be an ongoing"
861.99,"conversation we want you to hold"
863.61,"us accountable when we're in"
865.47,"that white house trying to do"
866.61,"all of this but we also have to"
869.52,"keep America safe and we have to"
872.04,"leave the world with steadiness"
873.45,"and strength now one of the"
876.24,"biggest differences in this"
878.28,"campaign has Donald Trump"
879.6,"basically says I alone can fix"
882.03,"it whatever it is they who that"
886.14,"leaves out that leaves out our"
890.04,"troops on the front line that"
891.48,"leads out our police and fire"
893.82,"responders to emergencies that"
896.61,"leads out our teachers are"
897.96,"educators who are working to"
899.43,"help young people leaves out"
901.23,"everybody"
902.04,"I alone can fix it I was raised"
904.65,"to believe that we're in this"
906.12,"together and together we can fix"
908.43,"it and"
909.11,"that is exactly what we're going"
910.79,"to do that's why tim kaine and i"
915.26,"are running a campaign of issues"
917,"not insults Donald Trump has a"
922.67,"different approach he wants to"
923.99,"build an economy that works even"
926.089,"better for himself"
927.98,"starting with a four billion"
930.29,"dollar tax cut for his own"
932.029,"family"
932.959,"he's built a career on sniffing"
936.62,"workers mom-and-pop contractors"
940.579,"small businesses that did jobs"
943.01,"for him and then he refused to"
944.45,"pay them I take this very"
946.19,"personally"
947.36,"my father was a small"
948.41,"businessman that's how he"
950.18,"provided a good middle-class"
951.29,"living for us he printed drapery"
954.89,"fabrics he would get the fabric"
956.66,"and roll it out on these big"
958.22,"long tables you take a"
959.54,"silkscreen and you put it down"
961.91,"you dump the pain in you take"
963.26,"the squeegee you go across you"
964.82,"lift it up you go down the end"
966.05,"of one table start on the other"
967.85,"end of the other table and you"
968.93,"do it until the job was done"
970.7,"sometimes I was there helping"
972.17,"him and then he would love the"
974.48,"fabric into his car and he would"
975.92,"deliver it"
976.91,"I tell you what I am so grateful"
978.74,"he never had a contract with"
980.6,"Donald Trump's businesses"
984.08,"in fact i just ran across the"
988.34,"story in Las Vegas when i was"
990.17,"there a few weeks ago of a small"
992.48,"drapery business who got what"
994.85,"they thought was the greatest"
995.9,"contract ever for Trump's new"
998.78,"hotel in las vegas they"
1000.94,"delivered the goods and they"
1003.82,"were refused payment for no"
1006.13,"reason other than its a game to"
1007.96,"him everything is a game it's"
1011.11,"like he's living in his own"
1012.55,"celebrity reality TV program you"
1018.34,"know what Donald this is real"
1020.41,"reality this as real people this"
1023.26,"is real decisions that have to"
1025.3,"be made for our country"
1029.65,"he actually stood on a debate"
1031.33,"stage and said wages are too"
1032.77,"high in America now he's got"
1035.65,"some new advisors had a bunch of"
1037.21,"advisors got some new advisors"
1038.74,"and they're all trying to make"
1040.839,"them look more presidential"
1042.19,"sound more serious not working"
1048.19,"too well but remember what my"
1051.49,"Angela who spent the last years"
1053.17,"of her life right here in this"
1054.25,"state at Wake Forest reminded"
1056.95,"all of us I think about it often"
1058.42,"i was so privileged to know her"
1059.89,"when someone shows you who they"
1063.16,"are believe them the first time"
1074.13,"you know strung together also"
1075.99,"means working with our true"
1077.55,"allies and partners around the"
1079.35,"world and last night I offered"
1081.51,"some thoughts about Isis Iran"
1084.87,"how we're going to reform the VA"
1087.15,"system to take better care of"
1088.44,"our vets and just since last"
1090.63,"night when I appeared on that"
1092.58,"program back-to-back with Trump"
1094.23,"is in the last 24 hours more"
1097.8,"retired generals and admirals"
1099.36,"have signed up to support my"
1101.1,"campaign"
1108.47,"people who have sacrificed and"
1111.169,"spent their lives protecting our"
1113.419,"country valuing what makes us"
1118.25,"exceptional and already great"
1120.919,"see Donald Trump and no he"
1124.97,"should not be anywhere near the"
1126.409,"White House he is"
1127.159,"temperamentally unfit to be"
1129.53,"President and Commander and"
1131.48,"change now tomorrow tomorrow i"
1137.179,"will hold i will hold a meeting"
1138.89,"of bipartisan bipartisan which"
1141.74,"is what i want to get us back to"
1143.179,"where Republicans and Democrats"
1145.61,"work together to make the"
1147.62,"changes to protect our country"
1149.78,"I'm going to be meeting with a"
1151.4,"bar pot bipartisan group of"
1152.99,"leaders and experts to focus"
1155.15,"more on these crucial challenges"
1156.86,"but it's hard to forget what"
1159.23,"Trump did last night it was a"
1160.85,"test and he failed it"
1163.85,"he he trashed talked about"
1166.76,"America's generals saying that"
1169.88,"they've been quote reduced to"
1172.19,"rubble"
1173,"he suggested he would fire them"
1174.65,"all and handpick his own general"
1176.419,"since you know he knows so much"
1177.5,"about what it takes to be a"
1180.289,"general attack dozens of former"
1183.71,"flag officers at the same time"
1187.1,"and here's what I want you to"
1188.39,"really here because even i was"
1190.97,"shocked by this and I didn't"
1192.08,"know much could shock me coming"
1193.61,"out of his mouth anymore"
1195.82,"he praised Russia's strongman"
1199.36,"Vladimir Putin even taking the"
1206.47,"astonishing step of suggesting"
1210.04,"he prefers the Russian president"
1212.41,"to our American president"
1217.01,"that is not just unpatriotic"
1218.87,"it's not just insulting to the"
1222.68,"office and the man who holds the"
1225.14,"office it is scary it is"
1227.57,"dangerous"
1232.61,"it actually suggests he will let"
1234.74,"Putin do what Putin wants and"
1236.63,"even make excuses for him i said"
1239.63,"this morning I was trying to"
1241.82,"think about what other"
