300.97,"in places like cedar rapids"
308.72,"now I also just want to say on a"
310.97,"personal note I was terribly"
313.46,"upset this morning to learn"
315.17,"about a train crash in New"
316.7,"Jersey that's very personal to"
319.22,"me I live in New York people"
321.35,"commute into New York from New"
322.91,"Jersey we had about a hundred"
325.07,"commuters injured and one died i"
328.37,"just want to send our thoughts"
331.01,"and prayers are to them because"
333.8,"it's a horrible accident that"
337.22,"ran into the depot and caused"
339.89,"all kinds of damage so I want to"
342.71,"lift up all the people of New"
344.6,"Jersey and New York today"
347.27,"now we are starting to vote in"
351.29,"Iowa today and I saw my good"

361.85,"line to vote today and we we"
367.25,"have what 40 days 39 days left"
370.73,"and each and every one of you"
373.43,"have the chance to make sure"
375.5,"that we keep our country on the"
377.69,"right path we have 40 days to"
380.93,"win an election that's going to"
382.28,"affect the next 40 years of our"
384.26,"country and you every one of you"
387.2,"can make the difference in this"
389.18,"election"
390.53,"how many of you participated in"
392.419,"the caucuses we've got we've got"
396.229,"a bunch of active Iowans here"
398.51,"are you ready to go to the polls"
403.39,"well luckily and I what you can"
407.05,"start today lots of folks don't"
409.03,"have that opportunity across the"
410.95,"country and a lot of our"
413.62,"campaign volunteers are going to"
416.59,"direct people right from this"
419.2,"rally to early voting sites"
422.02,"we've got one right down the"
423.52,"street so when you finish here"
426.37,"you can go vote and we can be on"
431.98,"the path to victory here in Iowa"
434.59,"any of you see that debate on"
439.57,"Monday night"
447.98,"well one down two to go well I i"
456.8,"have to tell you it was an"
459.89,"extraordinary experience because"
461.75,"i didn't get to say a few things"
463.97,"about the positive agenda that"
466.04,"we want to have for our country"
467.36,"because i want this election to"
469.76,"be about something not just"
471.38,"against somebody and so I am"
477.98,"going to close this campaign the"
479.84,"way I started decades ago"
483.14,"fighting for kids and families"
485.39,"because it's been the cause of"
488.84,"my life it will be the mission"
491.03,"of my presidency because I know"
494.18,"from my own experience that"
497.54,"strong families are the base of"
500.15,"a strong America and I know from"
503.12,"personal experience how"
505.58,"important it is to give people"
508.94,"the tools they need to make sure"
512,"that they can go as far as their"
514.669,"hard work their talent will take"
517.13,"them now you may have heard me"
520.58,"say this i started talking about"
522.14,"this way back in the beginning"
523.46,"of the campaign here in Iowa but"
526.46,"i was very fortunate you know"
530.06,"none of us picks our parents but"
533.63,"i really was fortunate you know"
537.38,"my dad was a Navy veteran a"
539.69,"small businessman and he worked"
543.26,"hard every single day to build a"
546.23,"good life to provide financial"
548.42,"security a good solid"
549.92,"middle-class life and I know how"
553.58,"hard he worked because"
554.48,"occasionally I'd go down to his"
556.13,"print plant where he printed"
557.63,"fabrics for draperies and it was"
563.33,"not a very big building it"
564.74,"didn't have any natural light"
566.15,"there were no windows in"
567.43,"that it's what he could afford"
568.899,"and there were two long tables"
571.12,"and he'd roll out the fabric and"
574.96,"then he would take a silkscreen"
576.07,"and if you ever seen a"
577.149,"silkscreen and old-fashioned"
578.68,"silting you know not far from"
580.81,"here there's a wonderful t-shirt"
583.089,"store right and and they still"
587.649,"use silk screens for some of"
589.18,"their printing so he would take"
591.04,"that silk screen and he put it"
592.66,"down and he would pour the paint"
595.029,"in then he take a squeegee and"
596.56,"go across it and then he lifted"
598.779,"up and go all the way down the"
600.58,"table and if there was going to"
602.08,"be more than one color he do it"
603.79,"all over again and then when he"
605.77,"finished he would gather it up"
609.1,"and put it in his car to go"
610.899,"deliver it to the customer who"
613.42,"had ordered it"
614.589,"that's how I was raised to think"
617.92,"about doing business you do your"
622.089,"best you enter into a contract"
626.38,"or an agreement somebody orders"
630.16,"your goods or services and then"
633.31,"they pay you for it right"
640.93,"and as I said the other night"
643.42,"one of the things that we have"
645.339,"found out is that has his own"
648.67,"campaign manager said about him"
652.089,"Donald Trump has built a lot of"
654.88,"businesses on the backs of the"
657.16,"little guy hurt words and I have"
661.45,"met people being who have been"
664.06,"the victims of his refusal to"
667.72,"honor contracts to pay what had"
670.66,"been bargain for i just am"
674.74,"grateful that my dad never did"
676.39,"business with him or somebody"
678.67,"like him because we couldn't"
681.37,"have survived that all that work"
684.459,"and then to be told we're not"
686.38,"going to pay you or maybe we'll"
687.76,"pay you ten cents on the dollar"
689.35,"or twenty cents that's just"
692.08,"wrong"
693.01,"what kind of person does that"
694.45,"takes advantage of dishwashers"
697.69,"and painters and architects and"
701.35,"glass installers and so many"
703.149,"people we've been looking into"
705.339,"the records and there's a long"
707.38,"list of people who have been"
709.779,"mistreated I just don't believe"
713.41,"that's the way we're supposed to"
714.85,"treat each other in America and"
716.98,"that sure is not the way our"
718.6,"president should be treating our"
721.45,"citizens in our country"
729.02,"now my mom had a very different"
731.27,"story you know my dad's father"
733.22,"was a factory worker but they"
734.6,"had a strong family my mom was"
737.6,"abandoned by her parents and"
739.73,"then sent to live with"
740.6,"grandparents and they didn't"
741.89,"want her so she was out on her"
744.14,"own by the age of 14 she was"
745.97,"working as a housemaid and a"
749.06,"babysitter and it may sound"
751.55,"harsh but I i will quickly tell"
754.49,"you that it was the first time"
756.86,"in her young life that she ever"
759.71,"was in a family that showed love"
762.83,"and respect for each other so"
765.26,"for her it was a gift and then"
767.72,"she got another gift the woman"
771.08,"she worked for knew that my mom"
772.76,"wanted to go to high school and"
775.79,"so the woman said you know if"
776.96,"you can get up really early and"
779.48,"you can get your chores done and"
781.1,"get the little kids off to"
782.57,"school you can go to high school"
783.83,"but you'll have to come right"
784.94,"back"
785.93,"that may sound harsh for 14 year"
789.8,"old but for my mother it made"
791.51,"all the difference and that's"
793.67,"exactly what she did for four"
795.26,"years and most days she had to"
797.6,"run run to get there but she"
800.66,"didn't care because she wanted"
802.22,"to get an education so when I"
805.43,"learn more about my mom's life I"
809.66,"knew that what I wanted to do"
811.34,"was to stand up for kids and"
813.23,"families and especially for kids"
815.72,"who've been left out or left"
818,"behind in some way"
821.67,"that's why I went to work for"
826.17,"the Children's Defense Fund and"
828.54,"learned quickly that kids with"
832.92,"disabilities were not in our"
834.51,"public schools back then and we"
837,"work to put together a coalition"
839.49,"and convince Congress to pass"
842.49,"the law and boy every day I am"
845.1,"so thankful for your former"
847.92,"senator tom harkin who made the"
850.02,"rights and opportunities of"
852.96,"people with disabilities the"
855.15,"centerpiece of his distinguished"
858.03,"career"
863.379,"so that's been my my mission"
867.97,"how are we going to do more to"
869.529,"help kids and families and so"
871.419,"when I talk about the economy"
873.369,"because i think we have three"
874.839,"big issues facing us number one"
877.599,"we need an economy that works"
879.369,"for everyone not just those at"
880.899,"the top right"
884.819,"we need to keep our country safe"
886.739,"and we need to lead the world"
888.869,"with strong and steady"
890.639,"leadership in accordance with"
892.979,"our values and we need to bring"
895.829,"our country together we have to"
898.619,"heal these divides but when I"
901.799,"think about the economy"
903.66,"yes I want more new good jobs"
906.059,"with rising incomes I see my"
908.309,"friends from the laborers here"
909.959,"we need to do work that builds"
912.72,"our roads our bridges our ports"
915.479,"our airports our tunnels our"
917.91,"water systems are sewer systems"
921.179,"this is good honorable work and"
925.439,"boy do we have a lot of it in"
927.089,"America we are living off the"
929.549,"investments that our parents and"
931.109,"our grandparents and sometimes"
932.699,"even great-grandparents made if"
935.369,"we're going to have a"
935.819,"competitive economy we need to"
938.129,"be building America again and we"
941.549,"also need to do more advanced"
943.109,"manufacturing and some of the"
945.299,"most exciting developments i saw"
948.089,"throughout this whole campaign"
949.379,"we're right here in Iowa I saw"
952.499,"in your community colleges some"
955.379,"of the most advanced training"
957.569,"that I've seen anywhere in the"
959.159,"country and I met young men and"
964.859,"women who were getting"
966.509,"credential to be able to leave"
968.729,"high school to get good jobs as"
972.119,"machinist and to land die makers"
974.369,"and as designers using 3d"
977.069,"printing i was so impressed and"
980.489,"I think we need to do that"
981.899,"across America and we need to"
984.509,"bring technical education back"
986.279,"to our high schools it was a"
987.569,"mistake when we took vocational"
989.429,"education out of our high"
990.989,"schools"
995.71,"another way that Iowa has"
998.5,"influenced and inspired me is"
1000.42,"what you've done with clean"
1001.68,"renewable energy"
1006.12,"wow it wasnt apart is an issue"
1008.16,"in Iowa it really got a big"
1011.85,"boost from your wonderful former"
1013.56,"governor tom vilsack but it's"
1017.7,"been continued over the years"
1019.65,"and look at the results look how"
1023.61,"much energy you are getting here"
1025.62,"in Iowa from clean renewable"
1027.3,"sources most particularly wind"
1030.66,"right and look at the number of"
1033.78,"jobs it's nearly 10,000 jobs now"
1036.15,"that are related to that plus"
1039.689,"the the renewable fuel standard"
1043.17,"which has motivated people to be"
1045.9,"creative about using biological"
1048.78,"material and experimenting with"
1051.15,"cellulosic material i was in the"
1054,"forefront of moving toward a"
1056.309,"clean renewable energy future"
1058.35,"and I'm excited by that I'm"
1064.86,"running against someone who"
1066.059,"thinks climate change is a hoax"
1067.59,"perpetrated by the Chinese"
1072.61,"I know it's real I believe in"
1075.73,"science"
1081.33,"but i'll tell you what else is"
1083.1,"real what's real are the"
1085.02,"economic opportunities the new"
1086.76,"jobs and businesses we're going"
1088.47,"to create by assuming the"
1090.99,"responsibility to combat climate"
1093.03,"change and the young people of"
1094.83,"our country are going to lead"
1096.69,"the way to doing that"
1105.62,"now we also need to help small"
1107.87,"businesses Iowa is filled with"
1110.36,"small businesses it should be"
1113.6,"easier to start 1 it shouldn't"
1115.34,"be so cumbersome to deal with"
1116.96,"all the multitude of regulations"
1119.3,"we're going to try to streamline"
1120.98,"that process being the daughter"
1123.86,"of a small business person I"
1125.36,"believe in giving people the"
1127.76,"chance to have their destinies"
1129.559,"in their own hands and we're"
1131.48,"going to work hard i want to be"
1133.309,"a first-class small business"
1136.43,"president and honor of my dad"
1137.69,"and I'm gonna do everything I"
1139.37,"can to help you get started and"
1141.2,"grow small businesses"
1145.389,"but while we're growing the"
1147.219,"economy we need to make it"
1149.169,"fairer and here are a couple of"
1151.269,"things I want to do"
1152.829,"let's raise the national minimum"
1154.539,"wage so people who work"
1156.309,"full-time or not still in"
1158.049,"poverty"
1161.829,"I've met you know two-thirds of"
1163.57,"the people on minimum wage or"
1164.919,"women and I've met a lot of"
1166.149,"minimum-wage workers right here"
1167.679,"and I went across America"
1169.059,"sometimes they have to take to"
1171.159,"minimum wage jobs because a"
1173.44,"full-time minimum-wage job will"
1175.659,"learn your $15,000 at the end of"
1177.729,"a full-time year of work we also"
1182.469,"could give the biggest boost two"
1184.749,"incomes and particularly family"
1186.399,"incomes if we finally guaranteed"
1188.649,"equal pay for women's work"
1198.269,"and the other thing i want to do"
1200.7,"is to make sure more companies"
1202.769,"adopt profit-sharing so if you"
1206.339,"helped to create the prophets"
1208.139,"all of you not just the top"
1210.479,"executives will be able to share"
1212.7,"in those profits"
1218.61,"you know at the debate the other"
1220.23,"night one of my well-known"
1222.78,"supporters Mark Cuban was there"
1225.45,"in the front row and he really i"
1228.6,"think unsettled my opponent but"
1233.61,"i'll tell you are Cubans a real"
1235.83,"billionaire who actually uses"
1237.9,"profit-sharing and not only"
1240.39,"while the business is ongoing"
1242.01,"but one thing I really"
1243.39,"appreciate first business he"
1245.73,"sold he shared the profits with"
1248.549,"all of his employees 300"
1251.61,"employees became millionaires"
1253.02,"because they had a boss who"
1255.33,"rewarded them for the hard work"
1257.52,"they did to make it a successful"
1260.4,"company altogether so in the"
1264.72,"final point I want to make about"
1265.95,"this is about family economics"
1268.169,"you know let's tackle the cost"
1271.32,"of childcare between 2000 and"
1274.74,"2012 childcare costs went up"
1277.29,"twenty-five percent incomes"
1278.97,"barely budge right so we're"
1282.51,"going to increase federal"
1283.65,"investment and provide more tax"
1285.48,"relief to working families so no"
1288.179,"parent has to pay more than ten"
1290.37,"percent of their income for"
1294.72,"quality childcare"
1299.049,"now if you don't have small"
1301.389,"children or grandchildren right"
1302.889,"now you may not realize the cost"
1305.23,"of childcare and a lot of states"
1307.269,"is more expensive than tuition"
1311.08,"at public colleges and"
1312.639,"universities a lot of families"
1315.759,"are just so stressed out the"
1318.82,"other thing i want to do is"
1319.779,"finally have our country join"
1321.489,"the rest of the advanced"
1322.779,"economies and provide paid"
1325.09,"family leave so you can take"
1327.549,"care of your family members now"
1333.669,"a lot of people think this is"
1335.08,"primarily about newborn babies"
1338.379,"adopted babies and of course"
1339.999,"that's a big part of it last"
1341.919,"year in newton mom said to me"
1344.08,"I'm counting on you to know what"
1347.139,"it's like trying to take care of"
1348.94,"a newborn and having to go right"
1351.1,"back to work right"
1353.919,"that's a lot of you there you"
1355.779,"are okay and i gotta tell you I"
1358.779,"hear that all over when when my"
1361.059,"granddaughter was born and I was"
1362.95,"in the hospital with my daughter"
1364.419,"I was talking to one of the"
1365.35,"nurses I said to what is your"
1367.48,"biggest worry she said well my"
1369.159,"biggest worry is that so many of"
1370.84,"these new moms have to go right"
1372.279,"back to work right back to work"
1374.769,"but it's not just for babies"
1377.619,"it's for sick children 6 spouses"
1380.289,"elderly members of your family"
1382.72,"who are having health problems"
1384.399,"there is nothing more important"
1387.97,"than caring for each other and i"
1391.96,"will tell you"
1394.98,"it is wrong to make it so"
1397.77,"difficult for American families"
1399.33,"the other big expense for family"
1404.37,"economics is education every one"
1407.22,"of our children deserve good"
1409.29,"teachers and good schools no"
1411.12,"matter what zip code 11 right"
1418.509,"and we also have to make college"
1420.999,"affordable"
1425.74,"yesterday in New Hampshire i was"
1429.22,"with my friend and my former"
1431.2,"opponent senator bernie sanders"
1433,"i am very proud of the campaign"
1439.72,"that Bernie and I ran it was a"
1441.429,"campaign about issues not"
1443.11,"insults and we share a lot of"
1447.91,"the same goals even though we"
1449.41,"have different ways of getting"
1451.45,"there so after was over he and i"
1453.16,"sat down and we began to hammer"
1456.309,"out some ideas about what we"
1458.17,"could do together and one of"
1460.78,"them was to make college tuition"
1463.84,"free for any family whose income"
1466.75,"is a hundred and twenty-five"
1467.98,"thousand dollars or less"
1474.97,"and to make it debt free for"
1477.58,"everybody else so that you only"
1479.289,"pay what you can afford to pay"
1481.24,"without going into debt now"
1486.19,"right now"
1487.12,"Iowans hold more than 12 billion"
1490.15,"dollars in outstanding federal"
1492.25,"student loans and education"
1494.86,"should give you a boost not hold"
1496.45,"you back and we're going to"
1498.46,"offer relief to those of you who"
1500.289,"already have debt we have 40"
1503.83,"million people who already have"
1506.169,"student debt in America 300,000"
1508.9,"of them right here in Iowa we're"
1511.21,"going to help you refinance it"
1512.89,"is outrageous that you can get a"
1515.679,"home mortgage of 3% a car"
1518.83,"payment a two percent and I met"
1521.049,"people in Iowa who were paying"
1522.46,"eight ten twelve percent"
1524.02,"interest on their student loans"
1526.39,"I'll tell you what I am NOT"
1527.86,"going to let the federal"
1528.82,"government make a profit off of"
1531.1,"lending money to young people to"
1533.71,"get their education"
1541.72,"and college is crucial but this"
1543.88,"is not set often enough for your"
1546.55,"college is not and should not be"
1548.32,"the only path to a good job that"
1550.93,"supports a metal clasp life so"
1556.24,"we're going to have real"
1557.44,"apprenticeships not the kind"
1559.66,"where you're told you're fired"
1560.92,"but the kind where you're told"
1561.88,"you're hired"
1567.399,"we're gonna help more people in"
1569.32,"high school and community"
1570.309,"college on-the-job learning a"
1572.71,"skill so I'm excited about what"
1575.379,"we can do together i know so"
1576.879,"much of this campaign has been"
1578.499,"about you know whatever my"
1580.69,"opponent says and who attacks"
1583.33,"and hui de rides and denigrates"
1586.509,"in the list is long but it's not"
1589.299,"about that it's about you it's"
1592.719,"about your families and your"
1594.549,"futures and each of us should be"
1597.219,"telling you what we intend to do"
1599.379,"in the job now I have this"
1601.929,"old-fashioned idea i'm asking"
1604.089,"for your vote"
1605.499,"I should tell you what I'm going"
1606.46,"to do what my plans are so tim"
1610.45,"kaine and I've actually put out"
1611.889,"this little paperback book and I"
1613.719,"see somebody holding one in the"
1615.129,"front row"
1616.179,"it's called not surprisingly"
1618.339,"stronger together you can pick"
1620.71,"it up at a bookstore airport"
1623.679,"wherever they sell paperbacks"
1625.269,"and you can see what we're"
1626.649,"trying to do and where we're"
1628.629,"going to get the money to pay"
1629.409,"for it and the simple answer to"
1631.749,"that is we're going to make the"
1633.609,"wealthy and corporations finally"
1635.859,"paid their fair share to support"
1638.2,"America"
1642.919,"my friends my opponent has a"
1644.989,"very different vision for"
1646.879,"America he actually bragged"
1648.71,"about gaming the system to get"
1651.23,"out of paying his fair share in"
1652.909,"taxes maybe not paying any taxes"
1655.909,"at all and what I really find so"
1659.269,"disturbing about this he spends"
1661.789,"all of his time just dumping on"
1665.45,"america calling us a third world"
1668.09,"country saying our military is a"
1670.999,"disaster that everything about"
1673.1,"America is in bad shape but then"
1676.46,"it's probably true he hasn't"
1678.379,"paid a penny and federal taxes"
1680.45,"to actually support our military"
1682.46,"or our bets or our schools or"
1685.94,"our roads or our education"
1688.159,"systems he actually is proud of"
1693.95,"the fact that he let everybody"
1694.97,"else pay taxes he says that"
1697.82,"makes him smart"
1700.96,"well I'll tell you what if not"
1704.98,"paying taxes make some smart"
1706.57,"what does that make the rest of"
1707.799,"us"
1709.929,"my husband and I have put 40"
1712.149,"years of our tax returns out"
1714.039,"into the public you can go look"
1716.23,"at him and you can see that"
1717.97,"we've been blessed and we're"
1720.61,"grateful for that but we have"
1722.049,"paid the highest marginal tax"
1723.88,"rates and we are glad we could"
1728.26,"because we have both benefited"
1731.71,"from this great country of ours"
1733.69,"and we want to pass that on to"
1736.69,"the next generation and the one"
1738.49,"after that"
1746.6,"Donald Trump is also proud that"
1748.7,"he rooted for the housing crisis"
1750.95,"back in 2008-9 think about that"
1756.169,"five million families lost their"
1760.309,"homes and he wrote it for it"
1763.22,"because he said he could make"
1764.39,"money off of it even said that"
1768.08,"it is just business"
1770.419,"well what kind of person"
1772.97,"believes that the throwing"
1774.89,"people out of their homes"
1776.12,"foreclosing on them destroying"
1781.789,"the dreams of hard-working"
1783.289,"people is just business"
1786.289,"well I'll tell you that's a"
1787.4,"person who should never be"
1788.48,"president because they don't"
1789.89,"understand the American Dream"
1792.02,"and how hard it is for people to"
1794.48,"make it"
1798.34,"so look I think after thank you"
1808.64,"I think after what we saw monday"
1812.12,"night will have two more debates"
1813.92,"to be able to contrast and"
1817.28,"compare I i have no idea what"
1821.21,"he's going to say the next time"
1822.59,"but I you know I i will spend"
1827.87,"some time preparing for it"
1834.16,"but we can't do any of the"
1836.83,"things that I just talked about"
1838.03,"or anything that you see in our"
1839.62,"book without your help"

1859.54,"have our differences for heaven"
1860.89,"sakes were Americans that's in"
