"start","word"
85.12,"hello everyone it's great to be"
87.19,"here at UNC Greensboro"
95.52,"I want to thank Martha for that"
99.39,"wonderful introduction it means"
101.88,"so much to have her here along"
105.96,"with her wonderful daughter"
109.079,"Sarah and her mother Barbara and"
113.549,"the story she told is really one"
116.909,"that motivates me every day"
119.789,"because it is kids like Sarah"
122.969,"that led me to politics in the"
125.399,"first place to try to make our"
127.469,"country and our world better for"
129.869,"them so to see Sarah grown-up"
132.989,"and thriving is very special and"
135.63,"your whole family support really"
138.209,"means the world to me"
139.44,"Thank You Martha Sarah"
145.85,"I have to say it's great to be"
147.47,"back on the campaign trail"
155.54,"as as you may know I recently"
159.079,"had a cough that turned out to"
160.879,"be pneumonia"
162.68,"I i tried to power through it"
165.769,"but even I had to admit that"
168.769,"maybe a few days of rest would"
170.78,"do me good"
177.09,"i I'm not great at taking it"
179.64,"easy even under ordinary"
181.14,"circumstances but with just two"
184.17,"months to go until election day"
186.18,"sitting at home was pretty much"
191.58,"the last place I wanted to be"
193.379,"but it turns out having a few"
197.28,"days to myself was actually a"
200.64,"gift i talked with some old"
202.98,"friends i spent time with are"
205.2,"very sweet dogs i did some"
208.62,"thinking you know the campaign"
210.93,"trail doesn't really encourage"
213.51,"reflection and it's important to"
216.48,"sit with your thoughts every now"
218.28,"and then and that did help me"
221.37,"reconnect with what this whole"
223.799,"campaign is about people like me"
228.569,"we're lucky when I'm under the"
231.51,"weather"
256.45,"but i just want to have a"
257.92,"conversation and other people"
260.47,"can wave their arms and their"
262.93,"signs but i want you i want you"
267.25,"to think with me for a minute"
269.29,"about how I certainly feel lucky"
272.74,"when I'm under the weather i can"
274.48,"afford to take a few days off"
275.89,"millions of Americans can't say"
279.58,"either go to work sick or they"
281.5,"lose a paycheck don't think lots"
284.71,"of Americans still don't even"
286.27,"have insurance or they do but"
289.93,"it's too expensive for them to"
291.49,"actually use so they toss back"
295.63,"some tylenols they chug orange"
298.12,"juice and they hope that the"
299.32,"call for the virus goes away on"
301.84,"its own"
302.98,"lots of working parents can't"
306.04,"afford childcare which in many"
308.59,"states cost as much as college"
311.17,"tuition so for millions of moms"
313.93,"and dads if they get sick"
316.81,"there's no backup they're on"
319.15,"their own aren't they"
321.19,"that's a story for too many"
322.84,"people still in America when"
326.38,"illness strikes or an accident"
328.45,"happens you feel you're on your"
331.84,"own if you lose your job or can"
336.01,"afford College"
337.48,"you're on your own if you're"
339.88,"aging parent starts needing more"
341.68,"help and you don't know what to"
343.87,"do"
344.62,"you're on your own and it's like"
346.51,"these are catastrophic for some"
349.51,"families"
351.79,"I have met so many people living"
355.42,"on a Razors Edge one illness"
358.27,"away from losing their job one"
360.58,"paycheck away from losing their"
363.34,"home and that goes against"
365.8,"everything we stand for as"
367.99,"Americans because some things"
370.15,"should not come down to look"
372.97,"something should be within reach"
375.43,"for everyone no matter what"
388.38,"like financial security like"
392.16,"affordable healthcare like the"
395.01,"peace of mind that comes with"
397.68,"knowing that if something goes"
399.75,"wrong your family will be ok"
403.05,"and above all the knowledge that"
406.35,"no matter what your president is"
409.35,"fighting for you and will always"
411.33,"have your back"
422.8,"that right there that's why I"
424.99,"got into this race I am running"
427.419,"for everyone working hard to"
429.31,"support their families everyone"
431.8,"who's been knocked down but gets"
433.539,"back up"
441.58,"the factory workers on their"
443.379,"feet all day and the nurses"
445,"looking after patients all night"
446.83,"i'm running for young people"
449.229,"like so many of you here who"
451.06,"dream of changing our world for"
453.759,"the better and for all the"
454.96,"parents and grandparents"
456.34,"supporting those dreams by"
459.28,"dedicating every dollar they can"
461.979,"spare to your education"
469.81,"I'm running I'm running for the"
472.389,"LGBT teenager here in North"
474.639,"Carolina who sees your governor"
476.98,"signed a bill legalizing"
478.09,"discrimination and suddenly"
480.73,"feels like a second"
492.61,"and if anyone wonders what the"
494.59,"cost of discrimination are just"
496.539,"ask the people and businesses of"
498.28,"North Carolina look that's"
500.259,"what's happening with the"
501.37,"n-c-double-a in the ACC this is"
504.52,"where bigotry leads and we can't"
507.129,"afford it"
508,"not here not anywhere else in"
510.939,"America"
519.15,"I'm running may of last year"
522.96,"Janelle was diagnosed with"
524.49,"breast cancer she went through"
526.65,"nearly six months of very tough"
528.78,"treatments last October she"
532.11,"brought her eight-year-old"
533.16,"daughter to one of our rallies"
535.23,"in Iowa and they made a huge"
537.57,"sign that read 13 chemo"
541.17,"yesterday three more hear me"
544.62,"roar"
550.02,"wouldn't you want to meet the"
551.79,"woman behind that sign well I"
553.98,"sure did"
555.72,"so we got talking and we stayed"
557.52,"in touch"
559.11,"she keeps promising me she'll"
561.3,"see me at the inauguration and I"
564.09,"tell her I'll keep working to"
565.95,"get there but she better be"
568.32,"there too i'm running for her"
571.23,"and all the mothers and fathers"
572.85,"trying to get and stay healthy"
575.28,"so they can be there for their"
576.75,"kids but perhaps most of all I'm"
581.04,"running for those kids"
589.84,"standing up for children has"
592,"been the work of my life as a"
594.28,"lawyer with the Children's"
595.42,"Defense Fund as first lady in"
597.91,"Arkansas in the White House as a"
599.98,"senator i have fought for kids"
602.53,"house in adult jails kids have"
605.41,"been neglected and abused kids"
607.78,"who couldn't get health"
609.01,"insurance because of"
610.9,"pre-existing conditions kids"
613.36,"with disabilities so they could"
615.07,"go to school you heard today"
617.56,"from someone I've known for a"
619.36,"long time now grown up in a"
621.79,"lovely young woman anastasiya"
623.92,"somoza I learned from my family"
627.04,"and my methodist faith that we"
628.93,"are each call to to all the good"
631.09,"we can for all the people we can"
633.73,"for however long we can and to"
636.79,"me that means making sure all"
639.64,"our children have the chance to"
641.41,"live up to their god-given"
642.79,"potentials"
652.91,"so when I need a little girl in"
654.65,"Nevada terrified that her"
656.18,"parents are going to be deported"
657.44,"it hits me right in the gut when"
660.5,"I meet a little boy in flint"
662,"michigan who can't drink the"
663.29,"water at home or in school"
665.18,"because it's poisoned with lead"
667.97,"that gets me going"
670.4,"all i want to do is get to work"
673.28,"making things better for them"
675.83,"that's why I care so much about"
678.02,"national security to I want to"
680.84,"give our kids a safer world to"
683.81,"me that means a world with"
685.31,"strong allies more friends fewer"
688.55,"enemies and fewer nuclear"
690.47,"weapons"
699.2,"it also means leading the fight"
701.48,"against climate change so we can"
703.19,"leave our kids a healthy planet"
711.059,"my opponent in this race"
712.949,"disagrees with me on every one"
716.069,"of these fronts just a few days"
718.709,"ago he said that if another"
721.319,"country's troops taunted ours"
724.139,"not fired at them but taunted"
728.279,"them just wants heat responded"
733.109,"he would respond by blowing them"
735.479,"out of the water he would start"
737.069,"a war over that"
743.2,"that is just one more reason my"
745.84,"friends why the stakes in this"
747.7,"election are as high as any in"
750.73,"our lifetimes"
752.32,"you know I've been involved in"
753.67,"politics and one way or another"
755.2,"for many years it is not an easy"
758.05,"business it can get rough and"
760.72,"I've built up some defenses when"
763.72,"it comes to public service i'm"
765.28,"better at the service part than"
767.05,"the public part but this is why"
769.66,"I do it"
770.71,"and this is who I minute for to"
773.29,"make life better for children"
775.12,"and families and that's what"
776.77,"this race has always been about"
778.93,"for me"
780.31,"well now we're in the final"
781.57,"stretch there are just 54 days"
784.3,"till Election Day just 54 days"
786.85,"till the most consequential vote"
789.94,"of our life"
797.649,"and just a little more than a"
799.809,"month until early voting starts"
802.269,"here in North Carolina let's"
807.129,"let's make these days count"
809.139,"particularly here because you"
811.269,"know what your governor and"
812.379,"legislature tried to do make it"
814.179,"harder for young people to vote"
815.829,"harder for people of color"
817.779,"harder for people with"
819.639,"disabilities harder for the"
821.98,"elderly"
823.149,"there can't be any more"
825.399,"motivation than that to make"
827.98,"sure every young person every"
830.559,"person of color every person"
832.689,"with the disability every older"
835.209,"person turns out and both"
844.96,"so in these final days let's try"
847.21,"to tune out all the chatter and"
849.34,"the nonstop analysis that"
851.8,"doesn't often have much to do"
853.96,"with what the next president has"
856.75,"to do to create good jobs to"
860.92,"create opportunity to make it"
862.69,"possible for every young person"
865,"to afford to go to college or"
866.89,"get the skills that you need for"
869.26,"the jobs of the future let's"
871.15,"talk about what really matters"
872.89,"and here's my promise to you i'm"
876.1,"going to close my campaign the"
877.72,"way i began my career and the"
880.12,"way i will serve as your"
881.35,"president should you give me"
883,"that great honor focused on"
885.28,"opportunities for kids and"
887.29,"fairness for families"
889.15,"next week I'll go to"
890.32,"Philadelphia to talk about"
891.55,"challenges facing our young"
893.23,"people in Florida focus on"
895.93,"building an economy that"
897.01,"welcomes everyone's"
898.72,"contributions including people"
900.58,"with disabilities then i'll be"
902.71,"back here in North Carolina to"
904.45,"meet with more working families"
906.37,"from now until november eight"
909.25,"everywhere i go i'm going to"
912.01,"talk about my ideas for our"
914.92,"country"
915.91,"you know my campaign has rolled"
917.59,"out detailed plans in 38"
920.41,"different policy areas yes"
922.12,"somebody actually counted"
923.29,"everything from raining in Wall"
926.17,"Street to creating good-paying"
927.52,"jobs to fighting Alzheimer's"
929.59,"supporting people with autism"
931.24,"you see I have this"
932.98,"old-fashioned notion that if"
935.83,"you're running for president you"
937.3,"should say what you plan to do"
938.74,"how you're going to get it done"
940.48,"and how you're going to pay for"
942.19,"it"
950.69,"you can read it all on my"
952.28,"website Hillary Clinton dot-com"
954.41,"we even put it in a new book"
955.79,"called you guessed it stronger"
958.4,"together get a copy of it"
963.68,"because it tells you everything"
964.94,"tim kaine and I intend to do now"
967.52,"like a lot of women i have a"
969.5,"tendency to over prepare I I"
973.04,"sweat the details whether we're"
974.78,"talking about the exact level of"
977.27,"lead in the water in Flint or"
979.49,"how many North Carolina kids are"
981.38,"in early enrichment programs or"
983.51,"the precise interest rate on"
985.73,"your student loans right down to"
987.56,"the decimal because you know"
993.5,"what it's not a detail if it's"
995.6,"your kid it's not a detail if"
998.03,"it's your family it's a big deal"
1000.25,"and it should be a big deal to"
1002.65,"your president"
1009.56,"now I confess I'll never be the"
1012.74,"showman my opponent is and"
1015.02,"that's okay with me"
1017.81,"just look at look at the show we"
1020.75,"put on with dr. oz today"
1024.06,"but i am going to deliver for"
1026.19,"you and your family just like I"
1028.26,"did for Sara all those years ago"
1031.2,"with the children's health"
1032.88,"insurance program that gave her"
1035.04,"a chance to be the extraordinary"
1037.47,"young woman she is"
1041.329,"and I'll tell you something else"
1043.429,"people accuse me of all kinds of"
1045.11,"things you probably have seen"
1046.189,"that"
1048.75,"but nobody ever accuses me of"
1051.93,"quitting and I will never give"
1053.97,"up"
1054.81,"I'll never walk away no matter"
1057.3,"how tough the going gets I'm"
1061.08,"actually asking Americans to"
1063.9,"hold me accountable for my ideas"
1065.94,"and hold my opponent accountable"
1068.73,"for his we don't need a"
1075.12,"president who says the minimum"
1076.86,"wages too high we need a"
1079.2,"president who knows that"
1080.49,"Americans deserve a raise to get"
1082.98,"to we don't need a president who"
1088.71,"wants to take away people's"
1089.85,"health coverage we need a"
1091.77,"president wants everyone to have"
1093.99,"quality affordable health care"
1096,"and we don't need a president"
1101.1,"who apparently thinks only"
1102.48,"married people deserve paid"
1104.16,"leave and only mothers ever stay"
1105.93,"home with the kids"
1110.52,"we don't need someone rushes out"
1113.19,"a half-baked plan just weeks"
1115.86,"before an election after decades"
1118.2,"of ignoring or putting down"
1120.9,"working moms we need a president"
1124.44,"who has spent years fighting for"
1126.69,"these issues who has a plan to"
1128.52,"support all families in all"
1130.98,"their various shapes ask"
1133.2,"yourself which candidate you can"
1135.75,"count on to be on your side"
1137.43,"respect your family"
1139.89,"stand up and fight for you and"
1142.86,"your kids"
1155.059,"that that is who you should vote"
1158.72,"for on november eight because as"
1161.749,"michelle obama said in her"
1163.22,"fabulous speech at the"
1164.749,"Democratic convention"
1166.399,"aww"
1168.65,"when we go to the polls this"
1173,"November the real choice isn't"
1176.36,"between Democrat or Republican"
1177.71,"it's about who will have the"
1180.74,"power to shape our children for"
1183.89,"the next four years of their"
1186.14,"lives"
1187.25,"it's also about the kind of"
1189.23,"country we want to be and what"
1191.27,"we want to leave behind for"
1193.52,"future generations people have"
1197.18,"to decide are we going to make"
1199.04,"our economy work for everyone or"
1200.93,"just those at the top are we"
1203.09,"going to bring people together"
1204.26,"or pit Americans against each"
1206.93,"other and rip our country apart"
1209.54,"are we going to work with our"
1211.97,"allies to keep us safe or are we"
1214.88,"going to put a loose cannon in"
1216.77,"charge who would risk everything"
1218.39,"generations of Americans have"
1221.84,"worked so hard to build now I"
1224.6,"have a lot of confidence in the"
1226.04,"American people and in our"
1227.63,"country my opponent keeps"
1229.82,"running us down saying where we"
1231.47,"can disaster an embarrassment"
1234.75,"every time he says things like"
1236.43,"that I think about Jenelle and"
1239.16,"her strength in the face of"
1240.42,"cancer or Martha and Sarah in"
1243.78,"the face of their health"
1245.01,"challenges and that little boy"
1246.87,"in Flint who gets up every day"
1248.97,"and goes to school even though"
1250.26,"you can't drink the water see my"
1253.2,"opponent has America all wrong"
1255.87,"there's nothing we can't do when"
1258.42,"we come together as one nation"
1260.94,"set big bowl and for so them"
1269.48,"and the American Dream the"
1271.52,"American Dream is big enough for"
1273.559,"everyone to share in its promise"
1276.83,"so if you believe the minimum"
1278.12,"wage should be a living wage"
1279.26,"that no one who works full-time"
1281.15,"should have to raise their child"
1282.83,"and poverty join us if you"
1285.32,"believe that every man woman and"
1286.94,"child in America has the right"
1289.13,"to affordable health care and"
1291.32,"women should be free to make our"
1293.179,"own health decision"
1302.06,"if you believe if you believe"
1304.16,"you're working mother wife"
1305.87,"sister or daughter deserves"
