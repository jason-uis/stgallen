784.69,"tried to do in this book and"
786.07,"it's so great having senator"
787.99,"Cain by my side now is to lay"
790.54,"out a blueprint for america's"
792.25,"future"
793.33,"how are we going to get more"
794.35,"good jobs infrastructure jobs"
796.78,"advanced manufacturing jobs"
798.91,"clean renewable energy jobs how"
801.4,"are we going to make sure that"
803.05,"the economy not only is growing"
804.94,"and producing more jobs with"
806.23,"rising incomes but is being fair"
809.71,"so the people are treated fairly"
812.41,"that's why we support we support"
815.26,"raising the national minimum"
817.33,"wage so that you're not living"
819.49,"in poverty when you work"
821.35,"full-time my opponent thinks"
825.1,"wages are too high"
826.84,"I don't know who he talks to but"
829.42,"he actually says that he doesn't"
830.65,"believe in raising the national"
832.27,"minimum wage i also believe in"
835.09,"doing more to support small"
836.2,"businesses"
837.4,"my dad was a small businessman i"
839.41,"believe that we need to do"
841.66,"everything we can to help small"
843.19,"businesses succeed"
845.26,"tim kaine and I were together in"
846.76,"Cleveland earlier we talked"
848.08,"about that Tim's dad ran a union"
851.98,"shop ironworkers and he's proud"
855.76,"of that that he had a small"
858.16,"business father who ran a union"
860.68,"shop and employee union workers"
863.23,"providing good products i also"
869.98,"believe that we"
871.99,"have got to finally guarantee"
873.79,"equal pay for women's work and"
882.52,"that's because I believe in"
886.33,"fairness I don't want to see"
888.49,"anybody treated unfairly and"
891.279,"discriminated against I don't"
892.66,"care who you are if you're"
893.41,"willing to work and do your part"
895.93,"you should be able to get ahead"
897.7,"and stay ahead that is the basic"
900.61,"bargain of america so if you"
903.04,"look at this book which I hope"
904.6,"you will it stands in stark"
907.18,"contrast to Donald Trump he says"
910.63,"I alone can fix it now the folks"
917.8,"i met during this campaign and"
920.8,"for many years before know that"
924.58,"we have challenges know we've"
926.68,"got to come together and believe"
928.81,"we have to work together to fix"
930.82,"what our problems are that's my"
934.27,"view i want us to bring people"
937.06,"together just the way unions do"
938.98,"just the way people in"
941.62,"communities do and here in the"
944.02,"Quad Cities and across the"
945.94,"country we can see proof"
947.77,"everyday that we have to come"
949.72,"together to meet our challenges"
951.19,"so I'm going to continue to"
954.85,"emphasize that we want to be the"
957.97,"United in this campaign we"
960.61,"believe that America is already"
962.589,"great and that we can become"
963.82,"greater if we do our part when"
970.51,"somebody says I alone can fix it"
973.45,"think of the people he's leaving"
975.97,"out everybody else leaving out"
978.61,"our troops on the frontlines"
980.47,"leaving out"
981.91,"firefighters and police officers"
983.38,"who run for danger leaving out"
986.38,"teachers and educators who do"
988.899,"their best to change children's"
991,"lives"
992.77,"leaving out everybody else that"
996.49,"is his campaign a nutshell and"
1000.15,"what we've got to do in the next"
1001.8,"sixty three days is to present"
1004.29,"the video"
1005.699,"in of America we believe in so"
1008.399,"we're going to continue to say"
1009.779,"we're stronger together we're"
1011.22,"going to work together we're"
1012.869,"going to run a campaign of"
1015.569,"issues not insults and we are"
1026.069,"going to be absolutely strong in"
1029.699,"our support for unions because"
1032.1,"we know nobody gets through life"
1036.209,"alone unions help build the"
1038.61,"largest middle class and the"
1040.289,"history of the world in our"
1041.699,"country they thought for fair"
1043.919,"wages safe working conditions"
1046.049,"they've helped so many people"
1048.659,"get on that wrong to the middle"
1050.789,"class and their kids like dick"
1053.25,"Durbin go even higher so i am"
1056.519,"going to say no to attacks on"
1060.72,"unions i'm going to say no to"
1064.47,"rolling back collective"
1065.82,"bargaining i'm going to say no"
1067.59,"to unfair trade deals like the"
1070.139,"TPP i'm going to say no no to"
1075,"pension cuts that deny you the"
1076.95,"secure retirement that you have"
1078.57,"worked for and i'm going to say"
1081,"no to right-to-work it's not"
1084.149,"right for workers and has not"
1085.83,"right for America but i will say"
1091.529,"yes to the American Dream and"
1094.019,"here's what i believe the"
1095.789,"American Dream is big enough for"
1097.289,"all of us if we build that we"
1099.99,"will expand it and create more"
1102.21,"opportunities and as we run this"
1106.049,"campaign on issues are most"
1108.69,"important our most important"
1111.57,"goal is getting the economy to"
1113.039,"work for everybody there's"
1115.169,"nothing nothing more important"
1117.929,"and how do you do that by"
1119.88,"creating more jobs and what are"
1122.549,"some of the areas that I think"
1123.75,"we can really emphasize"
1125.279,"infrastructure our roads our"
1128.34,"bridges our tunnels our ports"
1130.35,"our airports"
1131.399,"also what we can't see our water"
1138.659,"systems are sewer systems we"
1144.21,"also need a new electric grid a"
1147.269,"modern electric grid to be able"
1148.979,"to take and distribute clean"
1150.989,"renewable energy i have a goal"
1152.489,"for us to install a half a"
1154.379,"billion more solar panels by the"
1155.969,"end of my first term it takes a"
1160.769,"lot of a lot of jobs a lot of"
1162.869,"people working to do that and"
1165.299,"then enough clean energy to"
1168.45,"power every home by the end of"
1170.159,"my second term i also want to"
1176.369,"finish the work a broadband"
1178.95,"interconnectivity we have places"
1181.259,"in our country that still have"
1183.869,"dialogue we have places where"
1186.299,"kids can't do the homework"
1187.769,"assignments their teachers give"
1189.059,"them because they don't have"
1189.839,"access to the internet that is"
1192.089,"so unfair"
1194.009,"think of all the jobs will"
1195.929,"create we finish that off and"
1198.57,"then let's look at advanced"
1199.679,"manufacturing I believe we can"
1202.529,"compete with anybody if we put"
1204.599,"our minds to it and i'm going to"
1206.729,"have a manufacturing Renaissance"
1209.309,"policy that will put people to"
1212.549,"work"
1214.71,"i I am so proud that denison"
1216.929,"Lonnie are here because they've"
1219.179,"been doing so much to really"
1221.639,"create the new industries and"
1224.489,"autos and what the ib w does in"
1227.94,"so many important areas of our"
1229.71,"economy"
1230.759,"I want to be your partner and I"
1232.769,"think it's especially important"
1234.269,"to recognize that when the chips"
1238.799,"were down in the auto industry"
1240.869,"was on its back"
1243.089,"President Obama did the right"
1245.46,"thing he say the American auto"
1248.19,"industry"
1251.03,"I supported and then and I"
1256.43,"support him just as strongly now"
1258.44,"the American auto industry just"
1260.54,"had the best year it had in a"
1262.73,"long time and that was because"
1264.86,"of the teamwork and the"
1267.74,"partnership that we had between"
1270.95,"the companies between the Union"
1272.99,"and because the president united"
1275.24,"states knew we had to save the"
1277.73,"auto industry Donald truck"
1280.01,"basically said he didn't care"
1282.83,"didn't matter to him just shows"
1284.9,"you how he doesn't understand or"
1287,"care about the real jobs that"
1289.76,"put bread on the table and give"
1291.26,"people a sense of purpose and"
1292.73,"dignity"
1293.75,"well you won't have to look far"
1295.28,"to find me in the Oval Office if"
1298.85,"I'm fortunate to be your"
1300.02,"president to do everything I can"
1301.64,"every single day to create more"
1303.53,"jobs to save job to bring jobs"
1306.32,"back from overseas and if you"
1313.37,"contrast that with Trump his"
1315.68,"track record his track record is"
1319.13,"just the opposite"
1321.14,"he actually hired a"
1322.88,"union-busting firm for one of"
1326,"his hotels in Las Vegas he built"
1328.58,"a career out of not paying"
1330.65,"workers for the work they did"
1332.96,"we're talking painters plumbers"
1334.37,"electricians people who thought"
1337.82,"it was a big deal working for"
1339.47,"Donald Trump one of his resorts"
1342.08,"casinos he stiffed them he"
1344.9,"sniffs small businesses like I"
1347.06,"said my dad was a small"
1348.17,"businessman he printed drapery"
1350.27,"fabrics he get an order he buy"
1353.42,"the material he get the silk"
1355.82,"screens made i would go"
1357.08,"sometimes to help him in his"
1358.88,"print plan to have these long"
1360.92,"tables the fabric would be laid"
1363.14,"out you would take the"
1364.52,"silkscreen you put it down you"
1366.08,"pour the paint in you take the"
1367.91,"squeegee you push it across you"
1370.04,"lift the screen up to go all the"
1371.3,"way down get on the next table"
1373.01,"all the way back took a lot of"
1375.38,"time took a lot of hard work"
1377.42,"when he finished he load up the"
1380.54,"fabrics in his car and he go"
1382.7,"deliver them"
1383.69,"I"
1384.23,"and so happy he never got a"
1386.87,"contract from Donald Trump I"
1394.04,"don't know what my family would"
1395.6,"have done that my dad did"
1397.76,"business with people like Trump"
1399.29,"who has told hundreds and"
1402.65,"hundreds of small business he's"
1404.45,"been soon 4,000 times for not"
1406.28,"paying the bills that he owes"
1409.04,"feet if my dad had been told"
1411.26,"sorry just kidding we're not"
1413.6,"paying you"
1415.91,"this is a man who wants to be"
1416.87,"President United States this is"
1419.15,"someone who doesn't even honor"
1422.69,"contracts that's what is so"
1426.02,"dangerous about this election"
1428.57,"when Donald Trump says what he"
1432.14,"says about the economy you know"
1434.54,"that he knows how to create jobs"
1436.58,"he had six bankruptcies in one"
1439.13,"bankruptcy alone a thousand"
1441.169,"people lost their jobs the"
1444.5,"numbers add up"
1445.94,"he talks about wanting to"
1449.12,"protect jobs in America but"
1451.46,"everything he makes he's made"
1453.98,"overseas he could have made"
1456.5,"suits and ties and furniture in"
1458.54,"the United States but no he made"
1460.34,"overseas he even hires workers"
1463.669,"from overseas and he tells"
1465.919,"people"
1466.82,"well he couldn't find Americans"
1468.74,"who wanted to work in the heat"
1471.679,"you can't make this stuff up"
1474.679,"Canyon it is truly unbelievable"
1477.98,"but what's even worse is what he"
1480.95,"says about foreign policy as bad"
1484.07,"as he is about our economy he"
1487.25,"has insulted our allies he has"
1490.1,"made common cause with dictators"
1492.02,"he has basically endorsed"
1495.02,"Vladimir Putin and his policies"
1497.809,"when he says I know more about"
1500.6,"Isis than the generals"
1503.549,"when he claims are armed forces"
1507.389,"are a disaster or insult a gold"
1512.61,"star family that's not just"
1515.429,"offensive that's dangerous and"
1518.61,"just today our intelligence"
1521.07,"professionals said there was"
1524.1,"credible evidence for them to"
1526.83,"pursue an investigation into"
1529.289,"Russia's efforts to interfere"
1532.71,"with our election hacking the"
1536.609,"Democratic National Committee"
1538.409,"and what Putin was asked about"
1540.239,"it didn't deny it"
1541.95,"in fact he said it was probably"
1542.94,"a good thing that happened and"
1545.34,"this is the person that Donald"
1547.409,"Trump praises we saw even more"
1550.559,"evidence last week that is"
1552.779,"temperamentally unfit and"
1554.489,"totally unqualified to be"
1555.96,"president in just a few hours he"
1560.97,"managed to turn his trip to"
1563.159,"Mexico into an embarrassing"
1565.019,"international incident"
1566.82,"I mean just look at what"
1570.659,"happened you got into a Twitter"
1572.489,"war with the mexico and why"
1577.799,"because the President of Mexico"
1579.779,"set I told him in the meeting we"
1582.239,"weren't paying for that wall so"
1588.809,"not only did Trump mess up his"
1593.369,"first international engagement"
1594.509,"he choked he could even bring"
1599.19,"himself to tell the President of"
1600.72,"Mexico one of his very few"
1603.45,"policy demands I mean he went"
1608.399,"back to Arizona and gave another"
1610.409,"hate-filled speech about"
1612.69,"rounding up and deporting 16"
1615.269,"million people even some of his"
1618.179,"own advisors are having a hard"
1619.889,"time explaining that away so"
1623.159,"he's gonna try to distract and"
1624.809,"divide he's going to hope that"
1627.69,"we don't pay attention to what"
1629.909,"he's been saying for 14 15"
1631.859,"months we just tuned in now"
1633.899,"these last two months maybe some"
1636.539,"house"
1637.049,"often his positions that there's"
1639.119,"really another Donald Trump out"
1641.46,"there"
1642.989,"well you gotta ask yourself if"
1649.83,"you can't even go to a friendly"
1651.269,"foreign country without getting"
1652.59,"into a fight"
1655.559,"can this person even claimed to"
1659.039,"have the temperament to be in"
1660.299,"the Oval Office and deal with"
1662.7,"real urgent crisis as I've said"
1666.33,"before and I'll say it again"
1668.399,"a man who can be provoked by a"
1670.169,"tweet should not be anywhere"
1671.73,"near nuclear weapons but we have"
1683.1,"a lot of work to do"
1684.419,"I think every election is close"
1687.659,"and tight and tough"
1689.34,"that's why we have to work as"
1691.32,"hard as we can between now and"
1693.899,"when the last votes are counted"
1695.009,"and that's why I need your help"
1697.95,"I want to get the economy"
1699.059,"working for everybody not just"
1701.039,"those at the top I want to be"
1703.109,"sure that we leave the world"
1705.779,"with strength and steadiness and"
1708.179,"that we protect America here at"
1710.46,"home and around the world and i"
1713.309,"want to unify our country I"
1716.009,"believe with all my heart"
1723.04,"that every American must vote"

1731.08,"must vote please it will make a"
1733.18,"difference and then she says I'm"

1773.62,"could rebuild New York and the"
1775.72,"Pentagon and make sure we're as"
1778.3,"safe as we possibly could be"
1780.1,"this election will determine so"
1784.21,"much about our future and one"
1787.48,"thing I know for sure is"
1788.77,"we have to start listening to"
1791.32,"and respecting each other again"
1793.15,"we may have differences that's"
1796.18,"that's the American Way but we"
1800.26,"are stronger together we can do"
1803.32,"anything if we put our minds to"
1805.24,"it i saw the I saw the picture"

1834.49,"babies could take their babies"
1836.17,"to a safe place and those babies"

1839.91,"and when Mother Teresa asks you"
1845.37,"to do something the only answer"
