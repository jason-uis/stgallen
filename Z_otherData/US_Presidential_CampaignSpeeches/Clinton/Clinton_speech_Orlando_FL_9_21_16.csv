225.37,"to make our economy work for"
227.02,"everyone but first I need to say"
229.66,"something about two very"
230.77,"upsetting incidents that took"
233.02,"place over the past few days"
236.44,"first an unarmed man named"
238.45,"terrence Crutcher was shot and"
240.07,"killed by a police officer in"

263.77,"have two more names to add to a"
265.72,"list of african americans killed"
267.7,"by police officers in these"
269.95,"encounters it's unbearable and"
272.8,"it needs to become intolerable"
275.41,"we also saw the targeting of"
279.28,"police officers in Philadelphia"
281.89,"last week and last night in"
285.34,"charlotte twelve officers were"
287.979,"injured in demonstrations"

304.39,"weekend in new york and new"
305.86,"jersey and Minnesota are police"
309.25,"handled those terrorist attacks"
312.07,"exactly right and they likely"
314.71,"saved a lot of lives"
317.229,"I've spoken to many police"
319.75,"chiefs and other law enforcement"
320.979,"leaders who are as deeply"
323.74,"concerned as I am and deeply"
326.919,"committed as I am to reform why"
331.03,"because they know it is"
333.34,"essential for the safety of our"
335.71,"communities and our officers"
339.43,"we are safer when communities"
344.56,"respect the police and police"
346.39,"respect communities"
357.22,"I've also been privileged to"
359.59,"spend a lot of time with mothers"
362.53,"who have lost children and young"
364.42,"people who feel that as far as"
366.16,"their countries concerned their"
369.25,"lives seem disposable we've got"
372.34,"to do better and I know we can"
374.86,"and if I'm elected president we"
378.37,"will and we will do it exactly"
381.19,"together which is the only way"
383.5,"it can be done"
385.18,"look I know I don't have all the"
389.47,"answers I don't know anyone who"
390.94,"does but this is certain to many"
395.41,"people have lost their lives who"
397.78,"shouldn't have"
399.64,"Sybrina Fulton has become a"
402.85,"friend of mine her son Trayvon"
406.21,"Martin was killed not far from"
407.95,"where we are today"
409.3,"Sabrina says this is about"
412.24,"saving our children and she's"
414.82,"absolutely right"
416.29,"you need to come together work"
418.48,"together white black latino"
420.07,"asian all of us to turn the tide"
423.73,"stop the violence build the"
426.07,"trust"
433.529,"we need to give all of our kids"
435.239,"no matter who they are the"
437.309,"chance to grow up safe and"
438.929,"healthy in their communities and"
442.439,"in our country now there are so"
445.199,"many issues we need to take on"
447.029,"together and that's why we're"
448.889,"here today because in just 48"
452.219,"days can you believe it"
454.049,"48 days Americans will go to the"
458.879,"polls and choose our next"
460.949,"president"
472.71,"well I hope so I hope so"
477.61,"you know"
480.99,"I want to just stress that our"
484.2,"campaign is about the"
486.12,"fundamental belief that in"
488.61,"America every person no matter"
491.52,"what you look like who you are"
493.95,"who you love you should have the"
496.98,"chance to go as far as your hard"
498.81,"work and dreams will take you"
505.38,"that is the basic bargain that"
507.66,"made our country great and it's"
509.46,"our job to make sure it's there"
511.5,"for you and future generations"
513.09,"building an economy that works"
515.76,"for everyone not just those at"
517.44,"the top is the central challenge"
519.78,"of our time and I take it"
522.21,"personally because i'm a proud"
524.52,"product of the American"
525.84,"middle-class my grandfather"
528.09,"started working in a lace mill"
530.37,"in Scranton Pennsylvania when he"
532.17,"was just a boy and worked there"
533.64,"for 50 years thanks to him my"
536.61,"dad was able to go to college"
537.87,"and then start his own small"
539.58,"business printing fabric for"
541.41,"draperies and because of my dad"
544.5,"and my mom I could head out into"
546.9,"the world and follow my dreams"
549,"every American family should be"
552,"able to write a similar story"
554.22,"for themselves and their"
555.72,"children and history has shown"
558.06,"us our history has shown us that"
563.73,"the strongest growth in our"
566.13,"economy is inclusive broad-based"
569.4,"growth when everyone can"
571.95,"contribute to our prosperity and"
573.93,"sharing its rewards"
575.91,"now here's just one example the"
579.24,"flood of women into the american"
581.04,"workforce over the past several"
582.87,"decades was responsible for more"
586.65,"than three and a half trillion"
589.05,"dollars in economic growth"
594.819,"what as women's labor"
598.479,"participation has slowed in"
601.179,"recent years due in part to our"
603.85,"failure to provide"
605.049,"family-friendly policies like"
607.569,"paid leave and affordable"
609.309,"childcare so our economic bro"
612.579,"wasn't as strong as it could"
615.22,"have been women who want to work"
617.35,"deserve to work and whenever"
619.629,"they are denied that opportunity"
622.359,"it's not fair to them and we all"
624.399,"lose out in a competitive 21st"
628.329,"century global economy we cannot"
630.429,"afford to leave talent on the"
632.739,"sidelines when we leave people"
634.72,"out or write them off"
636.339,"we not only shortchange them and"
638.259,"their dreams shortchange our"
640.359,"country and our own futures"
643.749,"that's one reason why I care so"
646.239,"much about supporting working"
647.829,"parents it's one reason why I'm"
650.289,"such a strong supporter of"
651.729,"comprehensive immigration reform"
653.379,"because bringing millions of"
655.419,"undocumented workers into the"
657.189,"formal economy will decrease"
660.129,"abuse and exploitation and it"
662.559,"will increase our economic"
664.899,"growth and our tax things"
671.03,"it is estimated if we did this"
673.13,"despite what you hear from the"
675.02,"other side we would increase our"
677.48,"gross domestic product by an"
678.98,"estimated seven hundred billion"
680.78,"dollars in 10 years now we need"
683.96,"that it's also one reason why"
687.26,"we've got to break down barriers"
689.06,"of systemic racism including"
692.36,"underinvestment that upheld"
694.28,"communities of color back for"
696.23,"generation that's part of"
697.46,"building an inclusive economy"
699.05,"too and it's why i believe we"
701.9,"need to do more to help young"
703.07,"people who are left behind in"
705.77,"the wake of the Great Recession"
706.79,"find those strategies and"
710.51,"opportunities that will get them"
712.01,"moving ahead again and we've got"
714.32,"to help older Americans have"
716.33,"been displaced by automation and"
718.46,"outsourcing in our changing"
720.23,"economy and too often training"
725.9,"and Retraining doesn't work as"
728.33,"it should"
729.62,"you don't have a four-year"
730.82,"degree if you haven't really had"
734.36,"the chance to upgrade your"
736.64,"skills over the years it's hard"
739.31,"to just make a course correction"
742.4,"we need to have apprenticeships"
745.52,"and community college and"
747.32,"Technical programs starting in"
749.54,"high school and moving all the"
751.4,"way up to older workers"
755.1,"whether you're trying to start"
757.62,"your career or you spent decades"
759.42,"contributing to our economy you"
761.43,"deserve better"
762.87,"now these are some of the"
764.61,"elements of my plan for an"
766.08,"inclusive economy and I'm going"
768.06,"to hold up the book tim kaine"
769.41,"and i have put out because we've"
772.11,"actually put in one place all of"
774.66,"our plans"
775.89,"you see we have this"
776.61,"old-fashioned idea if we're"
778.08,"asking you to support us we"
781.23,"should tell you what we're going"
782.37,"to do"
790.95,"and today I want to focus on one"
794.79,"area that hasn't gotten enough"
796.41,"attention"
797.46,"it concerns a group of Americans"
800.19,"who are too often invisible"
803.1,"overlooked and undervalued who"
807.75,"have so much to offer but are"
809.88,"given to few chances to prove it"
813.27,"now that's been true for a long"
814.98,"time and we have to change it"
816.81,"i'm talking about people with"
818.88,"disabilities"
830.1,"men and women boys and girls who"
833.49,"have talents skills ideas and"
836.97,"dreams for themselves and their"
838.529,"families just like anybody else"
840.779,"whether they can participate in"
843.63,"our economy and lead rich full"
846.6,"lives that are as healthy and"
848.22,"productive as possible is a"
850.74,"reflection on us as a country"
852.899,"and right now in too many ways"
855.3,"we are falling short"
857.16,"we've got to face that and do"
858.87,"better for everyone's sake"
860.49,"because this really does go to"
862.5,"the heart of who we are as"
863.819,"Americans I intend this to be a"
866.43,"vital aspect of my presidency"
876.339,"I want to bring us together as a"
878.769,"nation to recognize the humanity"
880.72,"and support the potential of all"
883.72,"of our people and I want you to"
886.3,"hear this because this is not"
887.829,"well known nearly one in five"
892.059,"Americans lives with a"
894.61,"disability now some of those"
896.889,"disabilities are highly visible"
898.54,"some much harder to notice if"
903.22,"you don't think you know someone"
904.54,"with a disability i promise you"
906.459,"you do but their disability is"
913.269,"just one part of who they are"
914.829,"across the country people with"
918.43,"disabilities are running"
919.87,"businesses teaching students"
922.18,"caring for our loved ones"
923.889,"they're holding public office"
925.54,"making breakthrough scientific"
927.91,"discoveries reporting the news"
929.92,"and creating art that inspires"
932.709,"and challenges us"
941.41,"they're veterans who service and"
943.66,"sacrifice has protected our"
945.31,"freedom and kept our country's"
946.72,"safe they're working in the"
948.639,"White House just last year young"
952.149,"woman named Leah cats Hernandez"
955.06,"became the first West Wing"
957.069,"receptionist who is deaf so when"
960.31,"world leaders come to the White"
961.81,"House the person who greets them"
964.12,"is Leah think of the message"
967.269,"that sends about how our nation"
969.31,"sees the talent in everyone"
977.459,"and americans with disabilities"
979.439,"are working on presidential"
980.91,"campaigns"
982.079,"I know because several of my"
984.269,"staff and advisors have"
985.8,"disabilities and they're doing"
987.089,"phenomenal work i'm grateful to"
988.92,"them every single day and people"
994.619,"all over America would say the"
996.269,"same about their boss their"
997.86,"colleague their employee their"
999.72,"family member with a disability"
1000.889,"now over the past few decades"
1003.199,"our country has taken leaps"
1006.17,"forward not just in recognizing"
1008.689,"the humanity and dignity of"
1010.16,"people with disabilities but in"
1011.66,"making long overdue changes in"
1014.029,"our schools workplaces and"
1015.499,"communities so everyone can be"
1017.869,"part of our shared american life"
1019.999,"even so not that long ago if you"
1024.169,"had a disability if you couldn't"
1026.779,"see couldn't walk live with"
1029.809,"dyslexia or muscular dystrophy"
1031.939,"or some other health issues that"
1035.12,"one fact was allowed to define"
1037.88,"your entire life because of that"
1040.309,"and that alone the world was"
1042.589,"close to you"
1043.669,"not all of it not for everyone"
1045.86,"but for most people"
1048.169,"basic essential things that"
1049.85,"others could do you couldn't and"
1053,"never would and that was that I"
1055.909,"saw this for myself as Anastasia"
1058.07,"said years ago when I was just"
1059.72,"starting out as a young lawyer"
1062.029,"working with the Children's"
1063.529,"Defense Fund one of my first"
1065.63,"assignments was to figure out"
1067.52,"why so many American kids were"
1069.919,"in school we looked at census"
1072.14,"tract numbers and we said okay"
1073.46,"how many young people between"
1074.72,"five and 18 living this census"
1077.149,"tract then we would look at"
1078.559,"school enrollment numbers and"
1080.48,"there'll be a gap and we would"
1082.07,"say wait a minute where are the"
1083.809,"kids why aren't they in school"
1086.62,"I went door-to-door along with"
1088.03,"people across our country going"
1089.47,"into different communities I was"
1091.48,"in New Bedford Massachusetts we"
1094.24,"saw a notable disparity there"
1096.01,"and I soon realized that part of"
1097.63,"the problem was kids were stuck"
1099.97,"at home because of disabilities"
1102.64,"they were kids who are hard of"
1104.71,"hearing kids with intellectual"
1106.69,"disabilities"
1107.74,"I remember one little girl in a"
1109,"wheelchair who is smart curious"
1111.07,"desperate to go to school but"
1113.83,"that chair held her back"
1116.89,"not all schools had ramps or"
1118.66,"accessible bathrooms most"
1121.57,"teachers and aides were trained"
1123.46,"to help her so she didn't get to"
1126.01,"go"
1127.39,"it felt like the world had said"
1128.98,"to her sorry kid your life just"
1132.429,"isn't going to be worth very"
1133.809,"much and she and her family"
1135.88,"weren't rich they weren't"
1138.19,"powerful so what could they do"
1140.559,"about it"
1141.85,"that little girl reminded me of"
1143.47,"another little girl my mother"
1145.21,"she didn't face the same"
1147.19,"challenges but she too was"
1149.86,"blocked from a full and happy"
1151.12,"childhood abandoned by her own"
1153.88,"parents raised by grandparents"
1155.62,"who didn't water and ended up on"
1158.5,"her own when she was just 14"
1159.7,"supporting herself as a"
1161.32,"housemaid but then something"
1162.67,"finally went her way the woman"
1165.82,"she worked for encouraged her to"
1168.13,"finish high school and that"
1170.86,"family showed my mother what a"
1172.75,"happy family look like after"
1175.36,"many lonely years it was the"
1177.4,"start of a better life"
1179.35,"the core lesson from her"
1181.24,"childhood was that none of us"
1183.25,"gets through life alone we all"
1186.55,"have to look out for each other"
1187.929,"and lift each other up"
1194.659,"and I remembered that sitting"
1197.479,"with that little girl in a"
1198.679,"wheelchair"
1200.629,"my colleagues and I that the"
1203.09,"Children's Defense Fund along"
1204.59,"with others gathered the fact"
1206.33,"that we built a coalition of"
1208.519,"activists and families across"
1210.139,"America and together we help"
1212.299,"convince Congress to pass a"
1214.279,"groundbreaking law saying that"
1215.779,"children with disabilities have"
1217.789,"the same right to be educated in"
1220.039,"public school just like any"
1222.59,"other heads we open the doors to"
1229.94,"school and then some years later"
1232.789,"I was so excited when Americans"
1236.69,"with Disability Act finally past"
1239.239,"26 years ago it was bipartisan"
1242.149,"the notion that workplaces in"
1246.889,"public spaces belong to everyone"
1249.379,"with something Democrats and"
1251.299,"Republicans both supported and"
1255.109,"by the way i'm proud that some"
1256.999,"of the Democrats and Republicans"
1258.979,"who passed that landmark bill"
1260.869,"are supporting my campaign"
1262.46,"because they know where my heart"
1264.769,"is"
1272.559,"as Secretary of State I"
1274.179,"appointed the first-ever special"
1275.98,"advisor for international"
1277.029,"disability rights because I"
1279.49,"wanted America to stand up for"
1281.139,"the rights and dignity of people"
1282.61,"with disabilities all over the"
1284.44,"world and over the years I've"
1286.6,"spent a lot of time working for"
1288.129,"kids with disabilities in"
1291.279,"addition to Anastasia who spoke"
1293.59,"at the convention another young"
1295.12,"man Ryan Moore also spoke there"
1298.57,"i first met ryan when he was"
1301.749,"seven years old I was fighting"
1303.94,"for healthcare reform he was"
1306.399,"born with a rare form of"
1307.869,"dwarfism but he never let that"
1311.049,"stop him he's had so many"
1314.71,"surgeries we lost count of them"
1317.559,"but his family was always there"
1319.96,"for them and for him and and he"
1322.21,"was the advocate for himself as"
1325.24,"he got older now he's a college"
1327.82,"graduate working in the"
1328.899,"technology department of his"
1330.399,"local school district and he's"
1332.98,"just one of the most optimistic"

1336.789,"listening to ryan and Anastasia"
1338.71,"tell their stories at the"
1339.97,"convention this July made me"
1342.58,"think about all the people who"
1343.659,"never got the chance"
1345.159,"never got the chance to get the"
1346.419,"education let alone go to"
1347.83,"college become forces for change"
1350.289,"and I thought about all the"
1352.36,"mothers and fathers across"
1353.769,"America who love their children"
1355.48,"more than anything and want so"
1357.34,"badly for them to have every"
1359.499,"opportunity that they deserve to"
1361.509,"have in America"
1368.33,"I'll never forget something that"
1370.1,"the actor Christopher Reeve said"
1371.69,"some of you may be too young to"
1374.99,"know who he was he was a huge"
1377.12,"star"
1377.929,"he played Superman he was"
1379.7,"unbelievably good looking he and"
1385.07,"his wonderful wife were friends"
1386.96,"of mine and then he was"
1389.24,"paralyzed in a horse-riding"
1391.94,"accident he once said he had"
1394.88,"been thinking about a phrase"
1396.62,"that comes up a lot in our"
1398.12,"politics family values since my"
1402.919,"accident he said I've found a"
1405.889,"definition that seems to make"
1407.36,"sense i think it means that"
1410.269,"we're all family and we all have"
1412.789,"value"
1414.019,"I couldn't agree more"
1417.139,"we've come a long way since the"
1418.519,"fall of 1973 when I was going"
1420.919,"door-to-door talking to kids and"
1422.99,"families but make no mistake we"
1425.57,"still have a lot more work to do"
1427.159,"we can't be satisfied not won"
1429.169,"over sixty percent of adults"
1431.179,"with disabilities aren't in the"
1433.34,"workforce not when businesses"
1435.62,"are allowed to play to pay"
1437.33,"employees with disabilities a"
1440.059,"sub minimum wage"
1446.95,"not when people with physical"
1449.71,"and intellectual disabilities"
1451.54,"are still subjected to stigma"
1453.4,"and discrimination every single"
1455.08,"day"
1455.74,"we've got to build an inclusive"
1457.48,"economy that welcomes people"
1458.98,"with disabilities values their"
1460.72,"work treats them with respect"
1463.39,"now one advocate after another"
1465.64,"has told me the same thing we"
1467.98,"don't want pity we want"
1470.35,"paychecks we want the chance to"
1472.57,"contribute"
1476.77,"as president I'm going to give"
1478.99,"give them that chance first"
1481.66,"we're going to focus on jobs and"
1482.98,"incomes i'm going to fight to"
1484.84,"get more Americans with"
1485.95,"Disabilities the chance to work"
1487.51,"alongside those without"
1488.92,"disabilities and do the same"
1490.9,"jobs for the same pay and"
1493.12,"benefits"
1498,"people with disabilities"
1499.77,"shouldn't be isolated they"
1501.39,"should be given the chance to"
1502.77,"work with everyone else and"
1504.78,"we're going to eliminate the sub"
1506.34,"minimum wage which is a vestige"
1508.29,"from an ugly ignorant pass"
1513.87,"good work deserves a fair pay no"
1517.35,"matter who you are"
1519.09,"second we're going to work with"
1521.37,"our colleges and universities to"
1522.96,"make them more accessible to"
1524.52,"students with disabilities to"
1529.77,"have a truly inclusive economy"
1531.57,"we need a truly inclusive"
1532.71,"education system so let's raise"
1534.81,"our standards for too long"
1536.76,"accessibility has been an"
1538.2,"afterthought"
1539.94,"let's make it a priority in our"
1542.61,"curriculum our classrooms and"
1545.7,"the technology our students use"
1547.41,"it's like what Anastasia said"
1548.7,"about her sister she can"
1549.6,"communicate through a computer"
1550.74,"then let's make sure kids who"
1552.93,"can communicate that way have"
1554.73,"the opportunity to do so there"
1557.22,"are going to partner with"
1558.3,"businesses and other"
1559.65,"stakeholders to ensure those"
1561.48,"living with a disability can get"
1563.13,"hired and stay hard as part of"
1565.44,"that will launch a new effort"
1567.48,"we're calling autism works to"
1569.67,"help people with autism succeed"
1572.07,"in the workplace"
1577.57,"for let's build on the success"
1580.81,"of the Americans with"
1581.62,"Disabilities Act by finally"
1584.26,"ratifying the United Nations"
1585.85,"Convention on the Rights of"
1587.62,"persons with disabilities it has"
1592.93,"the strong backing of leaders"
1594.58,"across the political spectrum"
1595.72,"and it's a chance to show"
1597.52,"American values and American"
1600.73,"leadership and i have to tell"
1602.05,"you you know ever since I was"
1604.24,"first lady I've had the great"
1605.38,"privilege of traveling the world"
1606.79,"on behalf of our country when I"
1609.04,"was Secretary of State I went to"
1610.42,"a hundred and twelve countries"
1611.41,"and one of the things that i"
1613.18,"have noticed is how far behind"
1615.46,"many countries are and how they"
1618.55,"treat people with disabilities"
1621.07,"very often people with"
1623.68,"disabilities from the time they"
1626.98,"are babies and top locked away"
1629.68,"basically forgotten i want us"
1634.9,"since we have been the leader in"
1637.06,"this area to get that ratified"
1640.18,"and then to demonstrate other"
1642.4,"countries what we have done and"
1645.49,"are doing to give dignity and"
1647.56,"opportunity to people with"
1649.66,"disabilities"
1653.69,"now these are do these ideas are"
1655.58,"just a start we're working with"
1657.08,"advocates to come up with even"
1658.46,"more if you've got an idea we"
1660.529,"want to hear it go to Hillary"
1662.33,"Clinton calm and leave your"
1663.71,"ideas because we are really"
1665.33,"welcoming this debate this issue"
1667.73,"is very close to my heart"
1670.279,"I've always believed that the"
1672.71,"ultimate test of our society is"
1674.659,"more than the size of our"
1675.889,"economy for the strength of our"
1678.049,"military it's how we treat our"
1680.69,"fellow human beings especially"
1682.909,"the most vulnerable among us and"
1685.549,"on this front especially I"
1687.59,"intend for my presidency to move"
1689.629,"our country forward together we"
1692,"will make our economy and our"
1693.289,"country more welcoming to people"
1694.759,"with disabilities because we all"
1696.889,"win when everyone gets to share"
1699.259,"in the American dream"
