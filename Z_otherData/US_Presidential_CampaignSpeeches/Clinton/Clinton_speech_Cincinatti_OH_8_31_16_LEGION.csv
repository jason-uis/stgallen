355.58,"little bit about where I stand"
357.319,"and how I see the world and"
359.12,"America's place in it"
360.889,"I spent four years as your"
364.279,"Secretary of State eight years"
367.729,"before that as senator from the"
371.06,"great state of New York six"
376.46,"years on the senate armed"
378.56,"services committee if there's"
381.68,"one core believe that has guided"
385.4,"and inspired me every step of"
387.889,"the way it is this the United"
390.86,"States is an exceptional nation"
394.069,"I believe we are still Lincoln's"
396.439,"last best hope of Earth we're"
400.639,"still Reagan's shining city on a"
403.729,"hill"
404.87,"we're still Robert Kennedy's"
406.879,"great unselfish compassionate"
409.879,"country"
411.4,"and it's not just that we have"
413.8,"the greatest military or that"
415.87,"our economy is larger than any"
418.66,"on earth it's also the strength"
422.68,"of our values the strength of"
425.229,"the American people everyone who"
428.08,"works harder dreams bigger and"
430.87,"never ever stops trying to make"
434.02,"our country and the world a"
435.82,"better place and part of what"
438.61,"makes America exceptional nation"
441.25,"is that we are also an"
444.46,"indispensable nation in fact we"
449.169,"are the indispensable nation"
451.21,"people all over the world look"
454.78,"to us and follow our lead"
457.449,"my friends we are so lucky to be"
460.99,"Americans it is an extraordinary"
463.419,"blessing"
465.16,"it's why so many people from so"
468.55,"many places want to be Americans"
472.03,"to but it's also a serious"
475.57,"responsibility the decisions we"
478.87,"make and the actions we take"
480.849,"even the actions we don't take"
484.33,"affect millions even billions of"
488.11,"lives you know that you've seen"
492.61,"it all of this may seem evident"
495.58,"especially two men and women who"
497.68,"have worn the uniform"
500.19,"you may wonder how anyone could"
502.59,"disagree but in fact my opponent"
507,"in this race has said very"
508.23,"clearly that he thinks american"
511.71,"exceptionalism is insulting to"
515.37,"the rest of the world in fact"
518.729,"when Vladimir Putin of all"
521.28,"people criticized American"
524.76,"exceptionalism my opponent"
527.91,"agreed with him saying and I"
530.97,"quote if you're in Russia you"
534.63,"don't want to hear that America"
536.04,"is exceptional"
538.8,"well maybe you don't want to"
540.39,"hear it but that doesn't mean"
543.42,"it's not true my opponent mrs."
547.05,"something important when we say"
550.71,"America is exceptional"
553.92,"it doesn't mean that people from"
555.54,"other places don't feel deep"
558.6,"national pride just like we do"
560.61,"it means that we recognize"
563.43,"America's unique and"
567.09,"unparalleled ability to be a"
570.39,"force for peace and progress a"
573.87,"champion for freedom and"
575.79,"opportunity"
577.74,"our power comes with a"
580.2,"responsibility to lead humbly"
583.47,"thoughtfully"
585.779,"and with a fierce commitment to"
588.06,"our values because when America"
591.209,"fails to lead we leave a vacuum"
593.129,"that either causes chaos or"
596.67,"other countries or networks rush"
599.639,"in to fill the void so no matter"
602.61,"how hard it gets no matter how"
604.769,"great the challenge America must"
607.889,"lead the question is how we"
611.129,"leave what kind of ideas"
615.72,"strategies and tactics we bring"
618.809,"to our leadership American"
621.779,"leadership being standing with"
623.49,"our allies because our network"
626.639,"of allies is part of what makes"
628.68,"us exceptional no other country"
632.309,"in the world has alliances like"
635.009,"ours Russia and China have"
638.819,"nothing close we stand with our"
641.699,"allies because generations of"
643.98,"American troops fought and died"
646.709,"to secure those bonds and"
648.87,"because they deliver for us"
651.24,"every day our allies share"
655.139,"intelligence on terrorists they"
658.23,"provide staging areas for our"
660.72,"military so we can respond"
663,"quickly to events on the other"
664.589,"side of the world"
666.71,"other nations and soldiers"
669.53,"sailors airmen and Marines often"
673.52,"fight side-by-side with ours"
676.58,"some of you may have served and"
680,"fought alongside men and women"
682.97,"from other countries you saw"
685.61,"them in action"
687.44,"you know how important these"
689.15,"bonds are to our security"
691.28,"threatening to walk away from"
695.39,"our alliances ignoring the"
701.3,"importance that they still are"
704.72,"to us is not only wrong it's"
708.53,"dangerous if I'm if I'm your"
711.65,"president our friends will"
713.99,"always know America will have"
718.19,"your backs and we expect you to"
719.9,"have ours American leadership"
722.69,"means bringing the world"
723.89,"together to solve global"
725.75,"problems as only we can United"
730.1,"States built the international"
731.63,"coalition against Isis now we're"
735.08,"working with partners to take"
736.43,"back territory and defeat them"
739.22,"without getting drawn in to a"
740.99,"ground war we brought the world"
744.32,"together to impose sanctions on"
746.09,"iran and secure a deal that puts"
749.36,"a lid on Iran's nuclear program"
751.7,"without firing a single shot you"
755.6,"don't build a coalition by"
757.4,"insulting our friends are acting"
760.43,"like a loose cannon you do it by"
763.61,"putting in the slow hard work of"
767.75,"building relationships getting"
770.6,"countries working together was"
772.91,"my job every day as your"
774.71,"secretary of state more than a"
777.74,"photo-op it takes consistency"
780.23,"and reliability"
782.99,"actually it's just like building"
784.88,"personal relationships people"
788.33,"have to get to know that they"
789.68,"can count on you that you won't"
791.9,"say one thing one day and"
794.09,"something totally different"
796.22,"the next and it certainly takes"
799.49,"more than trying to make up for"
801.26,"a year of insults and"
803,"insinuations by dropping in on"
805.85,"our neighbors for a few hours"
807.23,"and then flying home again that"
810.05,"is not how it works"
812.33,"American leadership means"
814.58,"leading with our values in"
816.89,"pursuance of our interest in"
819.89,"protection of our security at"
821.72,"our best United States is the"
825.38,"global horse for freedom justice"
828.8,"and human dignity we celebrate"
832.31,"our diversity"
835.889,"as a source of national strength"
839.009,"just look at our armed forces"
842.1,"which represents all races"
845.73,"religions ethnicities and yes"
850.019,"immigrants from other countries"
851.249,"all fighting for the red white"
854.369,"and blue we stand up two regimes"
857.73,"that abuse human rights we stand"
861.059,"up for religious and ethnic"
862.799,"minorities for women for people"
865.23,"with disabilities and we comport"
868.23,"ourselves with honor"
871.589,"there's no better proof of that"
875.1,"then what our Navy SEALs did"
877.439,"during the raid to kill Osama"
879.48,"bin Laden"
887.12,"I was deeply honored to be part"
888.95,"of that small group advising the"
890.93,"president I brought to those"
893.839,"discussions my experience as a"
898.07,"senator from New York on 911 and"
902.12,"my commitment to do whatever I"
903.89,"could and whatever role I had to"
905.779,"bring bin Laden to justice"
908.45,"you've all seen the picture of"
909.95,"us crowded into the smaller"
913.67,"situation room watching the"
915.56,"video screen every second"
918.8,"counted one of the copters this"
924.77,"caged how high the wall was"
926.75,"around the courtyard clip the"
929.69,"tail getting disabled it didn't"
934.04,"stop the seals from rushing out"
936.11,"getting into the compound"
938.24,"returning fire against bin"
941.24,"Laden's body guards taking on"
944.42,"his adult son and finally bin"
947.27,"Laden himself but the seals knew"
950.63,"that they had to destroy the"
953.87,"helicopter before they left"
956.57,"I was holding my breath through"
959.51,"the entire operation because at"
962.99,"any time"
964.22,"pakistani soldiers could have"
966.77,"arrived this compound was in a"
970.94,"military garrison city actually"
973.16,"the home of their military"
975.529,"academy"
977.4,"so yes every second counted but"
981.45,"still our seals took the time to"
987.66,"move the women and children bin"
990.75,"Laden's family members to safety"
994.77,"before destroying the helicopter"
997.65,"that is what honor looks like"
1000.74,"that is America at our best"
1010.78,"maybe the soldiers of other"
1012.64,"nations wouldn't have bothered"
1013.99,"or maybe they have taken revenge"
1019.03,"on those family members of"
1023.32,"terrorists but that is not who"
1027.19,"we are and anyone who doesn't"
1029.95,"understand that doesn't"
1031.9,"understand what makes our nation"
1034.93,"great and let me say something"
1037.81,"else about American greatness"
1040.48,"there's no question we face real"
1044.59,"threats and real enemies that we"
1047.14,"need to confront and defeat but"
1051.76,"I opponent is wrong when he says"
1054.7,"America is no longer great"
1056.47,"consider a record of the past"
1059.74,"eight years in 2009 our global"
1064.48,"economy was collapsing Osama bin"
1068.95,"Laden was plotting we had more"
1072.19,"than 180,000 troops fighting two"
1076.57,"wars Iran was racing toward a"
1080.53,"nuclear weapon many of our"
1084.37,"allies were less supportive of"
1086.5,"American leadership that may"
1088.57,"have been in decades"
1091.36,"look where we are now we've"
1095.23,"pulled the global economy out of"
1097,"freefall thanks to the hard work"
1098.8,"and sacrifice of the American"
1101.26,"people"
1102.659,"we've redeployed well over"
1104.97,"100,000 troops from iraq and"
1107.46,"afghanistan so they can go home"
1109.799,"rest and train for future"
1112.32,"contingencies we cut off Iran's"
1115.919,"path to a nuclear weapon we"
1119.97,"convince Russia to reduce their"
1123.029,"nuclear weapons arsenal"
1125.759,"we protected our ally Israel and"
1128.549,"we brought Osama bin Laden to"
1130.289,"justice"
1131.549,"we did that we Americans did all"
1135.45,"of that working together across"
1137.309,"party lines and there is no"
1140.789,"question we have more work to do"
1142.679,"but let's be clear we are"
1146.369,"stronger together and it will be"
1148.739,"my goal if I am fortunate enough"
1150.989,"to be your president to bring"
1152.879,"people back together again to"
1155.309,"set our goals and move forward"
1157.59,"to achieve them"
1165.68,"I know you can cozy up to"
1167.9,"dictators we have to stand up to"
1170.6,"them we can't contain Isis we"
1174.17,"must defeat them and we will we"
1176.27,"will do whatever is necessary"
1177.77,"for as long as it takes to bring"
1181.37,"them to justice and end their"
1182.87,"reign of terror once and for all"
1184.73,"this election is about how to"
1188.51,"make things better now make no"
1192.2,"mistake i believe we do have"
1195.05,"better days ahead but things"
1199.19,"could also get worse if more"
1202.55,"countries get nuclear weapons if"
1205.61,"we abandon our allies if our"
1209.81,"commander-in-chief orders our"
1211.55,"military to break the laws and"
1213.65,"commit torture or murder"
1216.5,"terrorist family members"
1218.6,"that's why it is so critical we"
1221.24,"get this right and let me"
1225.83,"underscore what I've said"
1227.09,"throughout this campaign we must"
1230.99,"only send our troops into harm's"
1232.79,"way as a last resort not a first"
1236.45,"choice that must be our bedrock"
1239.99,"principle"
1244.65,"but we must be able to act"
1246.9,"decisively on our own when we"
1249.09,"need to i completely reject"
1252.72,"anyone including my opponent who"
1256.05,"calls the American military and"
1258.12,"i quote a disaster that is an"
1262.35,"insult to the men and women"
1264.84,"serving today and all who have"
1267.81,"served before who put their"
1269.28,"lives on the line"
1271.02,"it's just not true we do have"
1274.65,"more work to do to continue to"
1276.3,"have the strongest most"
1278.07,"effective military in the world"
1279.48,"i know this is something that"
1281.91,"matters a great deal to everyone"
1283.44,"in this room"
1286.2,"here's what we have to do we"
1287.97,"can't lose our military edge"
1289.47,"that means giving the Pentagon"
1292.05,"the stable predictable funding"
1294.45,"it needs to make smart"
1296.07,"investments you've heard"
1302.13,"you've heard of the sequester"
1304.47,"the arbitrary caps that Congress"
1308.97,"has imposed on our entire"
1311.22,"government for the past several"
1312.57,"years now look I am all for"
1315.12,"cutting the fat out of the"
1316.83,"budget and making sure we"
1318.87,"stretch our dollars and proud of"
1320.52,"the fact that when my husband"
1321.72,"left office we had a balanced"
1323.16,"budget and a surplus and I hope"
1325.8,"that someday we can get back to"
1327.45,"doing that but we cannot impose"
1330.15,"arbitrary limits and something"
1332.7,"as important as our military"
1334.14,"that makes no sense at all the"
1336.6,"sequester makes our country less"
1338.25,"secure"
1339.39,"let's send it to get a budget"
1342.03,"deal that supports America's"
1343.86,"military our families and our"
1346.2,"country and let's make reform a"
1348.63,"priority so that the defense"
1350.85,"department spends its budget on"
1353.22,"the right things and by the way"
1355.53,"the last thing we need is a"
1358.08,"president who brings more"
1359.37,"name-calling and temper tantrums"
1361.65,"to Washington"
1362.88,"we've got to get people"
1364.29,"listening to each other again"
1366.33,"getting both parties actually to"
1368.88,"work together let's modernize"
1371.82,"our army and marines are navy"
1374.73,"and air force our Coast Guard we"
1376.56,"need to respond to evolving"
1377.91,"threats from states like Russia"
1380.85,"and China Iran and North Korea"
1383.789,"from networks criminal and"
1385.529,"terrorist networks like Isis we"
1388.559,"need that military that is ready"
1390.09,"and agile so we can meet the"
1391.649,"full range of threads and"
1393.629,"operate on short notice across"
1395.159,"every domain not just land sea"
1398.009,"air in space but also cyberspace"
1401.279,"will invest in new technologies"
1404.279,"so new breakthroughs can"
1405.57,"transform our military just as"
1408.179,"stealth precision weapons and"
1410.789,"advanced communications did in"
1412.47,"the past will make a renewed"
1414.869,"push to reduce the world's"
1416.429,"nuclear weapons because that"
1418.679,"does make us all safer and will"
1421.32,"step up our efforts to secure"
1423.96,"nuclear material around the"
1425.879,"world had stop terrorists from"
1427.769,"acquiring or using weapons of"
1431.22,"mass destruction one of the"
1433.649,"first things i will do as"
1434.82,"president is to call for a new"
1437.099,"nuclear posture review we have"
1440.22,"to make sure that America's"
1441.809,"arsenal is prepared to meet"
1443.22,"future threats will invest in"

1449.149,"protecting us interests in outer"
1452.389,"space and cyberspace you've seen"

1461.33,"hacked into the Democratic"
1462.619,"National Committee maybe even"
1465.229,"some state election systems so"
1468.83,"we've gotta step up our game"
1470.059,"make sure we are well defended"
1472.639,"and able to take the fight to"
1474.019,"those who go after us as"
1476.45,"president I will make it clear"

1505.249,"so in short we have to be ready"
1508.669,"to win today's fights and"
1511.639,"tomorrow's but you know that the"
1515.419,"most important thing isn't the"
1517.909,"size of our military or the"
1519.619,"sophistication of our weapons"
1521.45,"the most important thing is our"
1524.149,"people the men and women who put"
1526.789,"on the uniform and serve we need"
1529.609,"to"
1535.13,"need to take a hard look at our"
1537.23,"military's personnel policies to"

1541.07,"everything to attract and keep"
1543.05,"the best and the brightest to"

1564.59,"gold star families who made the"
1566.81,"ultimate sacrifice for our"
1568.4,"nation"
1574.88,"or prisoners of war who endured"
1578.3,"so much in our name to insult"
1583.67,"them is just so wrong and it"
1587.42,"says a lot about the person"
1588.35,"doing the insulting in the"
1592.25,"Senate i worked with Republicans"
1594.17,"to increase the benefit paid to"
1595.94,"gold star families to expand"
1598.88,"access to military health"
1600.86,"insurance to make sure all"
1602.42,"members of the guard and"
1604.61,"reserves and their families have"
1607.04,"access to help benefits whether"
1609.11,"they're deployed or training at"
1610.82,"home I thought successfully to"
1613.67,"amend the 2007 defense"

1644.18,"outraged by the scandals at VA"
1646.37,"hospitals people waiting for"
1648.83,"months or years or wheelchairs"
1651.56,"and basic medications some even"
1654.59,"dying while waiting for an"
1656.24,"appointment"
1657.83,"I know that you heard from"
1659.93,"secretary McDonald and I know"
1662.66,"how hard he and his team are"
1664.4,"working we are going to build a"
1667.19,"21st century Department of"
1669.68,"Veterans Affairs that delivers"
1671.48,"world-class care and we are not"
1674.06,"going to let anyone privatize"
1676.31,"the VA we're going to reform and"

1708.69,"epidemic of veteran suicides by"
1711.51,"expanding access to mental"
1713.49,"health care and fighting the"
1715.71,"stigma that isolates too many of"
1719.31,"our veterans from getting the"
1721.11,"care that they need"
1725.31,"I feel passionately about this"
1727.56,"because i have looked into the"
1732.69,"eyes of too many family members"
1736.2,"who have lost their left one to"
1739.95,"suicide"
1743.13,"that's why I just two days ago"
1744.96,"when I released my plan to"
1746.82,"improve mental health services"
1748.14,"for all Americans"
1750.36,"I included a specific section"
1753.63,"about more help for veterans and"
1756.51,"their families because we know"
1758.13,"too many are getting the help"
1760.41,"they need right now we've got to"
1763.02,"serve them just as they served"
1765.39,"us we are also going to help"
1768.39,"more veterans looking for jobs"
1770.13,"with expanded tax credits for"
1772.29,"businesses that hire veterans"
1774.12,"more support to veterans who"
1776.22,"want to start their own"
1777.12,"businesses and making it easier"
1779.85,"for veterans to get credit for"
1782.52,"the skills they learned while"
1784.44,"serving"
1787.44,"and we will practice down on"
1791.19,"for-profit schools and companies"
1793.409,"that prey on or discriminate"
1795.72,"against servicemembers veterans"
1797.1,"or military families they should"
1799.32,"be ashamed of themselves and"
1802.169,"we're going to hold them"
1803.25,"accountable"
1805.169,"we will also work closely with"
1807.21,"the American Legion to clean up"
1810,"and expedite the appeals process"
1812.669,"benefits should be delivered as"
1815.909,"quickly as possible and appeals"
1818.73,"should be decided as"
1820.379,"expeditiously as possible"
1823.379,"I thank you for the work you are"
1825,"doing on that now a lot of what"
1827.879,"i have mentioned has support"
1829.679,"from Democrats and Republicans"
1831.539,"maintaining our military and"
1833.7,"caring for our veterans should"
1834.99,"never be a partisan issue"
1836.49,"defending American"
1838.799,"exceptionalism should always be"
1840.779,"above politics but this is not a"
1844.47,"normal election the debates are"
1849.84,"not the normal disagreements"
1851.49,"between Republicans and"
1852.899,"Democrats so i hope you will"
1855.179,"listen carefully to what my"
1857.759,"opponent and I propose consider"
1860.7,"our plans and the values behind"
1862.98,"them and after you've given us"
1865.98,"both a fair hearing"
1868.2,"I hope you will join the growing"
1869.909,"number of Americans Democrats"
1872.94,"Republicans and independence who"
1875.82,"are supporting our vision for"
1878.639,"the kind of future that we want"
1880.559,"for our country"
1882.12,"this election should be about"
1884.73,"ideology it's not just about"
1888.809,"differences over policy"
1891.12,"it truly is about who has the"
1893.669,"experience and the temperament"
1896.07,"to serve as president and"
1898.889,"commander-in-chief just three"
1901.769,"weeks ago 50 republican national"
1906.48,"security experts who served in"
1909.929,"Prior Republican administrations"
1913.379,"wrote a letter saying that they"
1916.47,"will not vote for Donald Trump"
1918.45,"because he would be in their"
1921.75,"words the most reckless"
1924.48,"president in American history by"
1928.559,"contrast I am deeply honored to"
1932.369,"have so many retired military"
1934.44,"leaders backing me along with"
1937.679,"these Republican experts I'm"
1941.49,"supported by people on both"
1943.08,"sides of the aisle and both"
1945.659,"sides of the debates that have"
1947.129,"defined our foreign policy for"
1949.47,"the last 30 years they know I"
1952.289,"believe in a bipartisan foreign"
1954.72,"policy they know I believe we"
1957.929,"should be finding ways to bring"
1959.34,"our country together around"
1961.2,"national security our role in"
1963.48,"the world our values"
1965.74,"they know they can count on me"
1967.809,"to do that and what matters to"
1971.98,"them is that we make the right"
1973.36,"choice in November the stakes is"
1977.2,"fall are as high as any election"
1979.66,"in our lifetimes"
1981.37,"so I'm going to keep raising"
1982.99,"these issues keep telling people"
1985.57,"where i stand laying out plans"
1987.49,"for what I do if I'm elected I"
1992.02,"have to tell you it is a little"
1993.07,"funny to me I get criticized for"
1994.75,"having so many plans people say"
1997.87,"oh there she goes with another"
1999.1,"plan about mental health about"
2000.9,"veterans well I have this"
2002.7,"old-fashioned idea i'm asking"
