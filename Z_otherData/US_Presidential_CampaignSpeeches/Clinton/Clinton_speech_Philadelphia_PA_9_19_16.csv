41.62,"I am so delighted to be here"
43.719,"with all of you I saw how much"
45.73,"fun President Obama had last"
47.5,"week and I wanted to be here in"
51.46,"Philadelphia before I began with"
56.23,"my remarks I do want to say how"
58.69,"proud I am of our brave first"
61.089,"responders working to keep us"
62.559,"safe after the attacks of the"
65.08,"last weekend in New York New"
66.61,"Jersey and Minnesota"
72.29,"there are now reports of a"
74.27,"suspect in custody but we must"
77.12,"remain vigilant"
78.2,"this is a fast-moving situation"
80.9,"and a sobering reminder that we"
83.78,"need steady leadership in a"
85.79,"dangerous world i'm here to talk"
89.18,"about a number of the issues"
91.01,"that are part of this election"
93.77,"but really much more than that"
95.54,"they're part of our future the"
98.51,"kind of country we want to have"
100.1,"the kind of people we want to be"
101.479,"in particularly what kind of"
104,"opportunities we should be"
106.46,"providing for the young people"
107.75,"of america i have a proud our on"
111.44,"my staff jumeirah burly"
118.84,"a Philadelphia native who became"
123.189,"an activist working to end the"
125.02,"epidemic of gun violence right"
127,"here in Philadelphia"
134.15,"she loves temple and we love her"
137,"and I also want to thank Lauren"
140.87,"for that introduction"
147.14,"jumeirah and Lauren are two"
150.17,"examples of why I do have so"
152.36,"much faith in our future"
153.95,"your generation is the most"
156.5,"inclusive progressive and"
158.84,"entrepreneurial that we've ever"
160.67,"seen and as you heard when"
163.22,"Lauren was in college she saw"
165.59,"challenges facing students of"
167.84,"color but there was no"
169.91,"n-double-a-cp chapter to support"
172.16,"them and promote diversity and"
174.38,"inclusion on campus so she"
176.209,"started one and Lauren remains"
178.76,"committed and engaged working"
180.68,"with an organization called"
181.79,"generation progress because she"
185.03,"understands that active"
186.65,"citizenship is a lifelong job"
189.709,"and the call of service never"
191.93,"fades now I know that with so"
195.8,"much negativity out there it is"
198.05,"really easy to get cynical"
199.97,"especially about our politics i"
204.019,"remember wrestling with that"
205.58,"challenge when i was a student"
207.23,"during the Vietnam War it can be"
210.38,"tempting to think that no one"
212.299,"will tell you the truth and"
214.07,"nothing's ever going to change"
215.51,"but you're here today because"
218.57,"you refuse to accept cynicism"
220.64,"you know that the next 50 days"
223.19,"will shape the next 50 years and"
227.57,"you see how much needs fixing in"
230.66,"our country from the soaring"
232.85,"cost of college to the scourge"
234.89,"of systemic racism to the threat"
237.47,"from climate change but you also"
240.2,"know the only way we can meet"
242.63,"those challenges is if we meet"
245.03,"them together"
246.44,"you're here because you believe"
249.2,"we can do just that"
251.12,"you want something to vote for"
252.89,"not just against optimism not"
257.6,"resentment answers not anger"
260.87,"ideas not insults bridges not"
265.85,"walls"
279.58,"you're also here because you"
281.169,"know this election isn't a"
283.689,"reality TV show it shouldn't be"
286.539,"about birth certificates or"
288.49,"name-calling or stop to get on"
291.52,"the table"
296.74,"this election comes down to a"
299.62,"choice between two very"
301.66,"different visions for america i"
305.169,"believe it's wrong to tear each"
307.03,"other down we should be lifting"
309.099,"each other up it's wrong to let"
311.65,"income inequality get even worse"
314.65,"we have to make the economy work"
316.18,"for everyone not just those at"
318.069,"the top and it's wrong to put a"
320.949,"loose cannon in charge who could"
322.72,"start another war we should work"
325.18,"with our allies to keep us safe"
328.27,"it comes down to this are we"
330.55,"going to pitt Americans against"
333.22,"each other and deepen the"
335.139,"divides in this country or are"
337.75,"we going to be as I know we can"
340.69,"stronger together"
351.87,"I know what I believe and I'm"
354.63,"going to close my campaign the"
356.85,"same way i started my career"
358.41,"fighting for kids and young"
361.38,"people and families that has"
363.81,"been the cause of my life"
370.23,"and it will be the passion of my"
371.85,"presidency and i hope you will"
373.41,"join me"
374.85,"we can't get distracted when the"
377.67,"media or my opponent turns this"
379.83,"election into a circus"
381.69,"my husband has a saying about"
383.91,"that he calls it majoring in the"
386.25,"miners getting so wrapped up in"
389.82,"stuff that doesn't matter you"
391.56,"forget what's really important"
393.39,"to your future and the future of"
396.03,"this country take the challenges"
398.82,"facing young Americans today"
400.5,"first of all if you're willing"
403.89,"to work hard you should be able"
405.3,"to find a good job that pays"
407.49,"well and lets you do what you"
409.74,"love and make your mark in the"
411.78,"world"
420.729,"but that's been out of reach for"
422.8,"too many young people trying to"
424.779,"find your footing in the wake of"
426.759,"the worst economic crisis since"
428.77,"the Great Depression that's why"
431.289,"tim kaine and I have a plan to"
433.599,"work with both parties and make"
435.58,"a historic investment in good"
437.86,"new jobs we can create millions"
440.919,"of jobs and make life a lot"
443.259,"better by doing things like"
445.569,"connecting connecting every"
447.46,"household to broadband by 2020"
450.159,"installing half a billion solar"
453.61,"panels building a cleaner more"
456.279,"resilient electric grid with"
458.83,"enough renewable energy to power"
460.839,"every home in the country"
466.27,"next getting an education should"
470.56,"give you a boost not hold you"
472.24,"back but as you know better than"
475.21,"most tuition keeps going through"
477.88,"the roof and debt keeps piling"
480.04,"up"
481.18,"I understand that temple was"
483.25,"founded to democratize diversify"
487.15,"and widen the reach of higher"
489.7,"education that is still a vital"
492.46,"goal so i worked with Bernie"
495.07,"Sanders on a plan"
504.56,"we came up with a plan that"
506.27,"makes public college tuition"
508.94,"free for working families and"
511.22,"debt free for everyone"
521.7,"and if you already have debt we"
524.76,"will help you refinance it and"
528,"pay it back as a percentage of"
531.69,"your income so you're never on"
534,"the hook for more than you can"
535.56,"afford"
541.75,"you can actually see how much"
544.36,"you and your family can save"
546.13,"under our plan by looking at the"
548.35,"college calculator that Hillary"
551.11,"Clinton dot-com and here's"
553.63,"something we don't talk about"
555.1,"enough a four-year degree should"
558.61,"not be the only path to a good"
560.29,"job in Eric"
567.279,"people should be able to learn a"
568.899,"skill practice a trade and"
571.06,"making a good living because of"
573.37,"that so we're offering new tax"
575.949,"credits to encourage companies"
577.48,"to offer paid apprenticeships"
580.12,"that lets you earn while you"
582.009,"learn and do more to dignify"
583.899,"skills across the board for"
586.99,"welders machinists health"
588.999,"technicians coders and so many"
590.889,"other fields"
597.99,"another challenge i hear about"
600.06,"all the time is from new parents"
603.029,"about how hard it is to balance"
605.49,"the demands of work and family"
607.2,"in today's economy families look"
610.56,"different today than they did"
612.029,"decades ago I think we can all"
613.709,"agree most need two incomes just"
617.76,"to get by and many people now"
620.49,"change jobs frequently and have"
622.41,"wildly unpredictable"
632.259,"treat that's why tim kaine and I"
635.229,"have a plan to help working"
637.269,"families with quality affordable"
639.069,"child care preschool and paid"
641.859,"family leave we fundamentally"
643.72,"believe"
650.72,"the more we can strengthen"
652.129,"families the stronger we will be"
654.62,"as a nation"
656.42,"everywhere I go young people"
658.1,"also share their concerns about"
660.68,"the divisive pneus and"
662.18,"discrimination we see in America"
664.43,"today you are and you shouldn't"
667.61,"be satisfied with the progress"
669.079,"we've made you should keep"
671.81,"wanting to right wrongs and"
673.67,"fight for justice and dignity"
675.47,"for all we see"
686.01,"as lauren said too many young"
689.16,"black men and women made to feel"
691.62,"like their lives are disposable"
693.39,"too many immigrants living in"
696.33,"fear of deportation too many"
699.78,"young LGBT Americans bullied too"
703.83,"many young women and men"
705.6,"sexually assaulted on campus or"
708.36,"in the military or at home"
723.87,"previous generations you"
725.55,"understand that all these"
727.65,"challenges are intersecting and"
730.56,"we must take them on together"
743.25,"but you also see a Republican"
745.89,"nominee for president who"
748.71,"incites hatred and violence like"
751.32,"we've never seen before in any"
753.69,"campaign hate speech being"
757.95,"normalized the dog whistles are"
761.16,"out in the open and yet despite"
763.92,"this I remain convinced"
766.29,"America's best days are ahead of"
768.93,"us in large part that's because"
772.23,"of the inspiring young people i"
774.33,"meet everyday i'm inspired by"
777.45,"Astrid I met her in Las Vegas"
779.82,"last summer she was brought to"
782.46,"this country from Mexico the age"
784.29,"of four with nothing but a doll"
786.78,"a cross and the dress she was"
788.91,"wearing"
790.35,"she's in her twenties and"
792.15,"advocating for the rights of"
793.62,"undocumented Americans and"
795.42,"comprehensive immigration reform"
797.28,"we should all join her in this"
799.74,"i'm inspired by Mikey who I met"
803.31,"in New York Mikey spent six"
805.65,"months in prison for a low-level"
807.27,"drug offense after he got out"
809.94,"Mikey discovered just how hard"
812.31,"it is for people who've done"
814.32,"their time to find good jobs and"
816.72,"opportunities but he persisted"
819.48,"and he managed to start his own"
821.85,"ice cream shop in New York and i"
823.89,"can recommend it's delicious"
826.52,"we have to do more to help"
828.41,"others get that second chance"
829.91,"including by banning the bottom"
836.64,"hawks and reforming our criminal"
849.68,"I'm inspired by Erica one of the"
852.47,"bravest young women I've ever"
854.06,"met her mother dawn was the"
858.11,"principle of Sandy Hook school"
859.76,"who died trying to protect your"
862.52,"students erica was devastated"
865.97,"but then she made it her mission"
868.19,"to advocate for common-sense gun"
870.589,"safety reforms it's been painful"
873.56,"for her a lot of hate has come"
876.529,"our way and the gun lobby is so"
879.44,"powerful but Erica won't give up"
882.589,"as she said what if everyone who"
886.22,"faced tough odds said it's hard"
888.8,"so I'm going to walk away that's"
891.47,"not the type of world I want to"
893.6,"live in"
894.62,"that's the spirit that makes"
897.23,"this country great"
899.57,"we might get knocked down but we"
901.43,"get right back up again"
914.73,"and we refuse to quit no matter"
916.769,"what and that's the spirit we"
919.139,"need in this election tube now I"
921.81,"know that with Washington"
923.1,"paralyzed by big money and"
924.66,"partisanship the gap between the"
927.779,"change we want in the progress"
929.85,"that politics should deliver can"
933.18,"look like a chasm you also know"
936,"that even if you are totally"
937.68,"opposed to Donald Trump you may"
940.019,"still have some questions about"
941.25,"me I get that and I want to do"
944.73,"my best to answer those"
945.899,"questions when it comes to"
948.12,"public service the service part"
949.92,"is always been easier for me"
951.42,"than the public part i will"
953.579,"never be the showman my opponent"
955.56,"is and you know what"
956.519,"that's okay with me"
969.95,"it's also true I do spend a"
972.89,"little time on the details of"
974.87,"policy like the precise interest"
978.29,"rate on your student loans right"
979.82,"down to the decimal but that's"
982.37,"because it's not a detail for"
984.11,"you"
984.62,"it's a big deal and it should be"
986.66,"a big deal to your president"
989.18,"so here's"
995.37,"so here's what I ask any voter"
997.47,"who is still undecided give us"
999.42,"both a fair hearing hold us"
1001.97,"accountable for our ideas both"
1005.51,"of us"
1006.71,"I can't promise you'll agree"
1008.24,"with me all the time but i can"
1009.71,"promise you this"
1011.18,"no one will work harder to make"
1013.76,"your life better"
1015.41,"I will never stop no matter how"
1017.72,"tough it gets in fact you can"
1020.45,"read about what Tim and I want"
1021.83,"to do"
1022.58,"we're not keeping it a secret"
1024.319,"we've got a book called stronger"
1026.27,"together"
1035.67,"but let me tell you a little bit"
1037.05,"about the values that drive me"
1039.57,"and my vision for the future"
1041.19,"because you deserve that from"
1042.96,"anyone running for president"
1044.4,"want to share with you the"
1047.34,"stories of three women who had"
1049.86,"pivotal moments changed my life"
1051.81,"and set me on a course of social"
1053.7,"justice activism and public"
1055.56,"service the first woman is my"
1058.44,"mother"
1059.19,"her name was Dorothy she was"
1062.37,"abandoned by her parents as a"
1064.23,"young girl she ended up out in"
1066.99,"her own at 14 working as a"
1069.12,"housemaid when I learned about"
1072.33,"this many years later I asked"
1076.17,"how she managed to grow up into"
1077.91,"a warm loving person and not"
1080.67,"become bitter and broken and"
1083.37,"here's what she said one word"
1085.83,"kindness she was saved by the"
1089.73,"kindness of others like the"
1092.76,"teacher who saw she had nothing"
1094.14,"to eat at lunch and brought"
1096.18,"extra food to share the lessons"
1098.67,"she passed on to me was simple"
1100.95,"but powerful no one gets through"
1104.61,"life alone we have to look out"
1107.19,"for each other and lift each"
1109.41,"other up"
1110.4,"she made sure i learned the"
1112.11,"words of one of the Creed's of"
1114.42,"our methodist faith to all the"
1115.98,"good you can for all the people"
1117.36,"you can in all the ways you can"
1119.19,"as long as ever you can"
1121.5,"that mission guides me still"
1123.63,"today when I stumbled it helps"
1125.91,"pick me up because there's"
1128.07,"always more good to do and more"
1129.81,"people to help if we keep our"
1132.03,"eyes open especially kids when I"
1136.2,"met a terrified little girl in"
1137.79,"Nevada who burst into tears"
1140.4,"because she worried her parents"
1143.37,"would he be deported it hit me"
1144.81,"right in the gut"
1146.1,"I knew how hard-working parents"
1147.84,"were I knew the sacrifices they"
1150.75,"were making so that she could"
1152.64,"have a better life when I met a"
1155.22,"little boy in flint michigan who"
1157.59,"got sick from drinking water"
1159.21,"poisoned with lead it just made"
1162.15,"me so"
1162.79,"angry and determined to work"
1164.98,"even harder every one of our"
1167.98,"children deserves the chance to"
1170.41,"share in the promise of America"
1172.03,"the second woman I want to tell"
1174.94,"you about is Marian Wright"
1176.2,"Edelman she was a lawyer for the"
1179.71,"n-double-a-cp in Mississippi"
1181.66,"first african-american woman to"
1183.82,"pass the Mississippi bar she was"
1186.88,"an ally of dr. King and robert"
1188.98,"kennedy and the founder of the"
1190.72,"Children's Defense Fund and"
1192.85,"altogether remarkable person one"
1196.45,"day during my first semester in"
1198.04,"law school I saw a flyer we used"
1199.66,"to have those flyers on a campus"
1201.58,"bulletin board and marion was"
1204.16,"coming to give a lecture I made"
1206.08,"sure to be there and what I"
1207.88,"heard was captivating American"
1210.79,"talked about creating a head"
1212.26,"start program in Mississippi and"
1214.78,"using her legal education to"
1216.58,"make life better for poor"
1217.99,"children and families something"
1220.72,"just clicked in my brain I began"
1224.68,"to see how I could translate the"
1227.59,"commitment to helping others"
1228.7,"I've learned from my mother my"
1230.35,"church into real social change"
1234.31,"I went up to her and I said"
1235.21,"could I work for you this summer"
1237.67,"she said sure but I can't pay"
1239.8,"you i said well i am paying my"
1242.32,"way to law school so i have to"
1243.94,"get paid"
1244.72,"she said well you can figure out"
1245.53,"how to get paid you can have a"
1247.69,"job"
1249.159,"so I figured out how to get a"
1251.559,"grant to get paid and went to"
1253.359,"work for her"
1254.769,"after graduation I could have"
1256.599,"followed my classmates to a"
1258.879,"high-powered law firm but I went"
1260.499,"to work for Marion at the"
1262.299,"Children's Defense Fund instead"
1263.769,"she sent me door-to-door in New"
1266.049,"Bedford Massachusetts on behalf"
1267.789,"of children with disabilities"
1269.109,"who were denied the chance to go"
1271.119,"to school back then and i"
1273.279,"remember meeting a young girl a"
1274.69,"wheelchair in the small back"
1276.22,"porch of her house she told me"
1278.499,"how badly she wanted an"
1279.849,"education but it just didn't"
1281.649,"seem possible"
1282.82,"my heart went out to her and I"
1284.859,"wanted to help but it became"
1287.139,"clear to me that simply carrying"
1290.259,"it is not enough that wouldn't"
1293.32,"force the public school to build"
1295.57,"more wheelchair ramps to put"
1297.099,"more resources into special"
1298.479,"education i learned that to"
