147.75,"thank you"
149.31,"now I have to I have to begin by"
152.01,"saying my original plan for this"
155.43,"visit was to focus on our agenda"
158.73,"to help small businesses and"
161.67,"entrepreneurs this week we"
164.19,"proposed new steps to cut red"
167.07,"tape and taxes to make it easier"

172.65,"credit they need to grow and"
175.02,"hire I want to be a small"
177.78,"business president my father was"
179.7,"a small businessman and i"
181.86,"believe that in America if you"
183.75,"can dream it you should be able"
185.25,"to build it and so will be"
191.1,"talking a lot more about small"
193.44,"business and about our economic"
195.15,"plans in the days and weeks"
196.739,"ahead but today here in this"
200.88,"community college devoted to"
203.22,"opening minds and creating a"
206.31,"great understanding of the world"
208.26,"in which we live"
209.97,"I want to address something that"
211.5,"I am hearing about from"
213.269,"Americans all over our country"
215.37,"everywhere I go people tell me"
219.989,"how concerned they are by the"
222.75,"divisive rhetoric coming from my"
225.06,"opponent in this election and I"
228.66,"i understand that concern"
231.18,"because it's like nothing we've"
233.22,"heard before from a nominee for"
237,"president of the United States"
238.5,"from one of our two major"
240.57,"parties from the start"
244.14,"Donald Trump has built his"
246.18,"campaign on prejudice and"
248.85,"paranoia he is taking hate"
252,"groups mainstream and helping a"
255.09,"radical fringe take over the"
258.75,"Republican Party his disregard"
261.9,"for the values that make our"
264.24,"country great"
265.32,"it is profoundly dangerous in"
268.92,"just this past week under the"
271.5,"guise of outreach to"
273.63,"african-americans Trump has"
276.24,"stood up in front of largely"
278.1,"white audiences and described"
280.17,"black communities in such"
282.48,"insulting and ignorant terms"
285.03,"poverty rejection horrible"
287.91,"education no housing no homes no"
290.88,"ownership crime at levels nobody"
293.79,"has seen right now he said you"
296.01,"can walk down the street and get"
297.96,"shot"
298.77,"those are his words but when i"
302.16,"hear them i think to myself how"
303.78,"sad"
305.22,"Donald Trump mrs. so much he"
307.65,"doesn't see the success of black"
309.45,"leaders in every field the"
311.55,"vibrancy of black-owned"
313.05,"businesses the strength of the"
314.79,"black church he doesn't see"
320.33,"he doesn't see the excellence of"
324.229,"historically black colleges and"
325.939,"universities or the pride of"
327.83,"black parents watching their"
330.11,"children thrive he apparently"
332.27,"didn't see police chief Brown of"
334.909,"dallas on television after the"
336.949,"murders of five of his officers"
338.81,"conducting himself with such"
340.939,"dignity he certainly doesn't"
345.71,"have any solutions to take on"
347.569,"the reality of systemic racism"
349.969,"and create more equity and"
352.219,"opportunity in communities of"
354.319,"color and for every American it"
356.78,"really does take a lot of nerve"
358.52,"to ask people he's ignored and"
363.8,"mistreated for decades"
366.139,"what do you have to lose because"
367.879,"the answer is everything"
377.54,"now Trump's lack of knowledge or"
381.17,"experience or solutions would be"
383.06,"bad enough but what he's doing"
385.76,"here is more sinister Trump is"
389.39,"reinforcing harmful stereotypes"
391.97,"and offering a dog whistle to"
396.5,"his most hateful supporters it's"
399.86,"a disturbing preview of what"
401.9,"kind of President he'd be and"
404.93,"that's what I want to make clear"
405.89,"today a man with a long history"
409.04,"of racial discrimination who"
412.25,"traffics in dark conspiracy"
414.77,"theories drawn from the pages of"
417.62,"supermarket tabloids and the Far"
420.95,"dark reaches of the internet"
423.05,"should never run our government"
428.87,"or command our military"
439.79,"ask yourself if he doesn't"
441.62,"respect all Americans how can he"
444.71,"served all Americans now I know"
450.74,"that some people still want to"
452.63,"give Trump the benefit of the"
453.92,"doubt they hope that he will"
456.5,"eventually reinvent himself that"
459.8,"there's a kinder gentler more"
461.93,"responsible Donald Trump waiting"
464.12,"in the wings somewhere because"
467.09,"after all it is hard to believe"
468.71,"anyone let alone a nominee for"
470.75,"president could really believe"
473,"all the things he says but"
476.21,"here's the hard truth there is"
478.43,"no other Donald Trump this is it"
481.13,"and Maya Angelou a great"
484.16,"American whom I admired very"
486.41,"much"
491.38,"she once said when someone shows"
493.69,"you who they are believe them"
496.75,"the first time"
503.29,"well throughout his career and"
505.96,"this campaign $YEAR donald trump"
507.94,"has shown us exactly who it who"
510.01,"he is and I think we should"
511.12,"believe him when he was getting"
513.31,"his start in business"
515.229,"he was sued by the Justice"
516.88,"Department for refusing to rent"
519.34,"apartments to black and Latino"
521.11,"tenants their applications would"
523.81,"be marked with a/c see for"
526.12,"colored and then rejected three"
529.24,"years later the Justice"
530.56,"Department took Trump back to"
532.21,"court because he hadn't changed"
533.95,"and the pattern continued"
536.32,"through the decades state"
538.9,"regulators find one of trumps"
541.45,"casinos for repeatedly removing"
544.12,"black dealers from the floor"
546.7,"no wonder the turnover rate for"
548.98,"his minority employees was way"
551.62,"above average and let's not"
554.17,"forget the Trump first gained"
556.39,"political prominence leading the"
558.85,"charge for the so-called"
559.99,"birthers he promoted the racist"
564.88,"why the president obama is not"
566.83,"really an American citizen part"
569.53,"of a sustained effort to deal"
571.57,"ahjumma mais America's first"
573.76,"black president and in $MONTH"
575.71,"2015 Trump launched his own"
578.59,"campaign for president with"
580.27,"another racist line he described"
583.15,"mexican immigrants as rapists"
585.04,"and criminals and he accused the"
587.11,"mexican government of actively"
588.67,"sending them across the border"
590.86,"none of that is true and oh by"
594.34,"the way"
597.42,"by the way Mexico's not paying"
601.23,"for his wall either"
608.62,"it's if he ever tries to get it"
610.9,"built the American taxpayer will"
613.78,"pay for it will be stuck with"
616.69,"the bill but there has been a"
620.47,"steady stream of bigotry coming"
622.9,"from him"
623.98,"I think we all remember when"
625.84,"Trump set a distinguished"
627.43,"federal judge born in indiana"
629.2,"could not be trusted to do his"
631.72,"job because quote he's a Mexican"
634.06,"think about that the man who"
637.24,"today is the standard bearer of"
639.28,"the Republican Party said a"
641.17,"federal judge who by the way had"
643.24,"a distinguished record as a US"
645.34,"Attorney had to go in hiding"
646.9,"because mexican drug gangs were"
648.82,"after him who has mexican"
651.88,"heritage but just like me was"
654.28,"born in this country is somehow"
656.53,"incapable solely because of his"
659.17,"heritage even the Republican"
661.27,"Speaker of the House of"
662.62,"Representatives Paul Ryan"
664.69,"described that and i quote as"
667.27,"the textbook definition of a"
669.55,"racist comment and to this day"
672.79,"to this day Trump has never"
676.93,"apologized to judge curio but"
680.35,"for Trump that is just par for"
682.18,"the course this is someone who"
684.76,"retweets white supremacist"
688.27,"online like the user who goes by"
691.69,"the name white genocide TM Trump"
696.07,"took this fringe bigoted with a"
699.4,"few dozen followers and spread"
702.4,"his message to 11 million people"
704.53,"his campaign famously posted an"
708.94,"anti-semitic image a star of"
711.01,"david imposed over a sea of"
713.53,"dollar bills that first appeared"
715.96,"on white supremacist websites"
718.51,"the Trump campaign has also"
722.41,"selected a prominent white"
725.02,"national nationalist leader as a"
728.77,"delegate in California and they"
730.66,"only dropped him under pressure"
732.79,"when asked in a nationally"
735.16,"televised interview whether he"
738.25,"would disavow the support of"
739.87,"David Duke a former"
742.27,"Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan"
744.91,"Trump wouldn't do it and only"
747.76,"later again under mounting"
749.8,"pressure did he backtrack and"
752.98,"when trump was asked about"
754.81,"anti-semitic slurs and death"
758.08,"threats coming from his"
760.12,"supporters he refused to condemn"
762.73,"them through it all he has"
765.58,"continued pushing discredited"
768.31,"compute conspiracy theories with"
770.77,"racist undertones you remember"
774.13,"he said that thousands of"
776.62,"American Muslims in New Jersey"
778.63,"cheered the 911 attacks they"
781.99,"didn't he suggested that Senator"
784.9,"Ted Cruz's father was involved"
787.21,"in the Kennedy assassination now"
791.68,"perhaps in Trump's mind because"
794.95,"mr. Cruz was a Cuban immigrant"
797.41,"he must have had something to do"
799.03,"with it and there is absolutely"
801.13,"of course no evidence of that"
803.35,"just recently Trump claimed that"
806.77,"President Obama founded Isis"
811.42,"and he has repeated that over"
813.19,"and over again"
815.44,"his latest paranoid fever dream"
818.56,"is about my health and all i can"
826.48,"say is Donald dream on"
837.86,"but but my friends"
848.329,"but my friends this is what"
850.61,"happens when you treat the"
852.079,"National Enquirer like gospel"
854.48,"they said in October I'd be dead"
858.29,"in six months"
859.699,"it's also what happens when you"
862.61,"listen to the radio host alex"
864.829,"jones who claims that 911 and"
868.249,"the Oklahoma City bombings were"
870.139,"inside jobs he even said and"
875.239,"this really just is so"
876.589,"disgusting"
877.759,"he even said the victims of the"
880.549,"sandy hook massacre were child"
882.829,"actors and no one was actually"
885.98,"killed there i don't know what"
888.679,"happens in somebody's mind or"
890.959,"how dark their heart must be to"
895.639,"say things like that but Trump"
898.429,"doesn't challenge these lies he"
900.739,"actually went on jones show and"
902.6,"said your reputation is amazing"
905.54,"i will not let you down"
908.809,"this from the man who wants to"
910.399,"be President of the United"
911.66,"States you know I've stood by"
915.11,"President Obama side as he made"
917.149,"the toughest decisions a"
918.649,"commander-in-chief has to make"
920.779,"in times of crisis our country"
923.989,"depends on steady leadership"
925.249,"clear-thinking com judgment"
928.579,"because one wrong move can mean"
931.429,"the difference between life and"
932.899,"death"
933.799,"I know we have veterans here and"
935.839,"i know we have families mothers"
937.429,"and spouses and children of"
939.35,"people currently serving the"
942.049,"last thing we need in the"
943.399,"Situation Room is a loose cannon"
945.019,"who can't tell the difference or"
947.239,"doesn't care to between fact and"
950.509,"fiction and who buys so easily"
952.97,"into racially tinged rumors"
961.279,"someone so detached from reality"
963.8,"should never be in charge of"
966.079,"making decisions that are as"
967.759,"real as they come"
970.339,"and that is yet another reason"
973.279,"why Donald Trump is simply"
975.949,"temper mentally unfit to be"
977.809,"President of the United States"
983.79,"now I I here and I read some"
987.78,"people who are saying well that"
989.55,"his bluster and his bigotry is"
991.53,"is just overheated campaign"
993.09,"rhetoric an outrageous person"
996,"saying outrageous things for"
998.04,"attention but look at his"
1000.38,"policies the ones that Trump has"
1003.83,"proposed they would put"
1005.75,"prejudice into practice and"
1008.87,"don't be distracted by his"
1010.43,"latest efforts to muddy the"
1012.17,"waters he may have some new"
1014.69,"people putting new words in his"
1016.37,"mouth but we know where he"
1018.41,"stands he would form a"
1020.51,"deportation force to round up"
1022.49,"millions of immigrants and kick"
1024.5,"them out of the country he"
1026.18,"abolished the bedrock"
1027.59,"constitutional principle that"
1029.72,"says if you're born in the"
1030.86,"United States you're an American"
1032.57,"citizen he says that children"
1034.61,"born to undocumented parents in"
1037.76,"America are anchor babies and"
1039.41,"should be deported millions of"
1041.63,"them he'd ban Muslims around the"
1044.3,"world from entering our country"
1046.1,"just because of their religion I"
1048.89,"think about that for a minute"
1050.72,"how would that actually work til"
1054.32,"people landing in US airports"
1056.93,"would line up to get their"
1059.45,"passport stamp just like they do"
1061.31,"now but in Trump's America when"
1064.52,"they step up to the counter the"
1066.5,"immigration officer would ask"
1068,"every single person"
1069.71,"what is your religion and then"
1073.04,"what what if someone says i'm a"
1076.04,"christian but the agent doesn't"
1077.39,"believe him"
1078.38,"do they have to prove it how"
1081.8,"would they do that"
1083.03,"really ever since the Pilgrims"
1086.24,"landed on Plymouth Rock America"
1089.21,"has distinguished itself as a"
1091.82,"haven for people fleeing"
1093.95,"religious persecution believing"
1096.41,"in religious freedom and"
1098.12,"religious liberty"
1106,"under Donald Trump America would"
1108.58,"distinguish itself as the only"
1110.5,"country in the world to impose a"
1113.71,"religious test at the border now"
1117.28,"come to think of it there"
1118.93,"actually maybe one other place"
1120.94,"that does that the so-called"
1122.05,"Islamic state the territory that"
1125.89,"isis controls what a cruel irony"
1129.04,"that someone running for"
1131.5,"president would equate us with"
1135.13,"them now but don't worry some"
1138.1,"will say as president Trump will"
1140.92,"be surrounded by smart advisors"
1143.08,"who will reign in his worst"
1144.7,"impulses so when a tweet gets"
1148.93,"under his skin and he wants to"
1150.37,"retaliate with a cruise missile"
1151.66,"may be cooler heads will"
1154.15,"convince him not to"
1156.25,"well maybe but look at who has"
1159.64,"put in charge of his campaign"
1161.59,"Trump likes to say only hires"
1165.4,"the best people but he had to"
1167.5,"fire so many campaign managers"
1169.45,"it's like an episode from the"
1170.8,"apprentice"
1181.2,"and the latest shake-up was"
1183.299,"designed to quote let Trump be"
1185.669,"Trump so to do that he hired"
1188.19,"Steven Bannon the head of a"
1191.49,"right-wing website called"
1193.559,"breitbart.com as the campaign"
1195.809,"CEO now to give you a flavor of"
1199.049,"his work here are a few"
1200.639,"headlines they've published and"
1203.279,"I'm not making this up"
1205.35,"birth control makes women"
1207.179,"unattractive and crazy would"
1211.889,"your would you rather your child"
1214.74,"had feminism or cancer"
1219.299,"Gabby Giffords the gun control"
1222.12,"movements human shield hoisted"
1226.95,"high and proud the Confederate"
1229.23,"flag proclaims a glorious"
1231.33,"heritage"
1233.75,"and that one came shortly after"
1235.88,"the Charleston massacre when"
1238.4,"Democrats and Republicans alike"
1240.71,"we're doing everything they"
1241.76,"could to heal racial divides"
1243.83,"that Breitbart and Bannon tried"
1245.96,"to inflame just imagine Donald"
1249.71,"Trump reading that and thinking"
1250.94,"this is what I need more of in"
1253.64,"my campaign now badan has nasty"
1257.24,"things to say about pretty much"
1259.52,"everyone this spring he railed"
1262.55,"against Speaker Paul Ryan for"
1265.19,"quote rubbing his social justice"
1268.76,"Catholicism in my nose every"
1271.01,"second"
1271.88,"no wonder he's gone to work for"
1273.89,"Trump the only presidential"
1275.27,"candidate ever to get into a"
1277.19,"public feud with the Pope"
1279.71,"it's truly it's truly hard to"
1286.61,"believe but according to the"
1288.05,"Southern Poverty Law Center"
1289.46,"which tracks hate groups"
1292.34,"Breitbart embraces ideas on the"
1296.06,"extremist fringe of the"
1297.71,"conservative right is not"
1299.87,"conservatism as we have known it"
1302.39,"this is not republicanism as we"
1304.43,"have known it"
1305.45,"these are racist ideas"

1317.87,"as the alt right now alright is"
1322.13,"short for alternative right"
1324.62,"The Wall Street Journal"
1325.64,"describes it as a loose but"
1329.06,"organized movement mostly online"
1331.16,"that rejects mainstream"
1333.56,"conservatism promotes"
1335.48,"nationalism and views"
