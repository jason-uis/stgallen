564.18,"time to be part of this campaign"
565.98,"and i'm going to run through"
568.74,"some of the reasons why every"

577.02,"heads into the future with"
578.97,"confidence and optimism that we"
581.82,"truly are stronger together"
583.41,"because that's what will"
586.5,"determine whether we have the"
588.78,"economy that produces more good"
591.48,"jobs with rising incomes whether"
594.24,"we have an education system that"
596.4,"prepares our young people for"
598.08,"the jobs of the future whether"
599.37,"college is affordable whether"

620.85,"there is an exciting bold agenda"
623.94,"before us but it cannot be done"
627.51,"by any one person"
629.19,"it must be done by all of us and"
632.52,"that is something that Donald"
634.02,"Trump does not understand"
641.39,"amen among the many among the"
645.11,"many troubling things that were"
646.94,"said at his convention and"
648.23,"honestly I sometimes didn't"
650.96,"recognize what country they were"
652.37,"talking about was so dire so"
655.67,"dark so divisive so dangerous"
659.18,"but among the things he said was"
662.78,"I alone can fix it"
668.06,"think of who that leaves out our"
672.35,"men and women in uniform troops"
674.3,"on the front line people like"
676.52,"Mary who put on the uniform of"
679.82,"the Air Force to serve our"
682.31,"country think about the police"
685.22,"and firefighters who rushed or"
687.89,"danger think about those brave"
690.53,"police officers and emergency"
692.72,"responders in orlando when the"
695.99,"pulse nightclub was attacked"
698.21,"think about all the teachers the"
702.65,"educators the professors and"
704.87,"staff"
708.29,"who work to give young people a"
710.72,"much better chance in the race"
713.6,"of life think about all the"
716.6,"hard-working people who can't"
720.56,"build a house by themselves can"
723.139,"erect one of Donald Trump"
725,"skyscrapers by themselves"
728.959,"think of all the small"
729.8,"businesses that take a big"
732.019,"chance my dad was a small"
733.97,"businessman I know what a chance"
735.62,"it is he couldn't do it alone"
737.69,"you need customers he had"
739.279,"suppliers he needed workers"
741.589,"Americans don't say I alone can"
745.009,"fix it we say we'll fix it"
747.709,"together just watch us nobody"
749.66,"nobody can solve problems better"
752.269,"than we can"
758.019,"and I want to be a president for"
760.449,"all Americans not some Americans"
762.699,"Democrats Republicans"
764.23,"independents every single"
767.079,"American i want to be a"
771.009,"president for those who vote for"
772.569,"me and those who vote against me"
774.249,"because I want to bring our"
775.329,"country together i'm very proud"
780.999,"that tim kaine and i are running"
782.589,"a campaign of issues not insults"
785.319,"because i believe anybody who is"
790.809,"asking for your vote for the"
792.85,"most important job not just in"
795.189,"the country but in the world"
796.629,"should tell you what they plan"
800.29,"to do i do have this I guess"
804.339,"it's an old-fashioned idea if"
806.86,"you're going to ask people for"
808.48,"their vote that have some idea"
810.129,"what they're voting for and I"
812.949,"don't think it's enough to say"
814.119,"oh i'll tell you later"
815.799,"I think it's important to lay it"
818.92,"out and to tell you how it's"
820.989,"going to be paid for and that's"
823.24,"why"
824.529,"starting today especially for"
827.079,"young people but really for"
828.879,"everybody we are putting out a"
831.1,"book it's called stronger"
832.629,"together and in it"
836.24,"it shows this is more than a"
839.209,"slogan for the campaign"
841.22,"this is a blueprint for"
842.93,"america's future"
848.6,"among the things that we talk"
850.31,"about is the core of our agenda"
852.5,"as laid out in this book it is"
856.64,"building an economy that works"
858.29,"for everyone not just those at"
860.27,"the top we're going to make the"
865.58,"biggest investment in new job"
868.31,"since world war two"
869.089,"infrastructure jobs like the OC"
876.92,"report our roads our bridges our"
880.339,"tunnels our ports our airports"
882.17,"they need work and there are"
884.779,"millions of jobs to be done and"
888.95,"in addition to what you can see"
891.41,"what about our water systems are"
893.209,"sewer systems we need a new"
896.12,"modern electric grid to be able"
898.88,"to take and clean renewable"
900.56,"energy that can then move us"
903.589,"toward that future we see"
910.03,"I have a plan to install a half"
913.3,"billion solar panels by the end"
915.16,"of my first term"
920.69,"and enough clean energy to power"
922.67,"every home in America by the end"
924.68,"of my second term"
929.449,"and I want young people"
930.889,"especially to be part of this to"
933.709,"be in science technology"
934.97,"engineering manufacturing"
937.669,"creating this future that will"
941.269,"determine the quality of your"
942.919,"lives and the competitiveness of"
945.259,"our economy we also have to"
947.48,"finish extending broadband"
949.669,"access to every place in America"
951.619,"right now seventy percent of our"
957.709,"teachers say that they assign"
959.419,"homework to their students"
960.769,"starting in elementary school"
962.569,"they require the kids to learn"
964.79,"how to use the internet I think"
966.049,"that's great we want to have a"
968.389,"an internet savvy population but"
971.72,"here's the problem 5 million"
974.389,"homes where little kids live"
976.459,"where high school kids live"
978.47,"don't have the internet what"
980.749,"does that mean that means"
981.499,"they're already behind"
983.059,"it's so unfair we're gonna make"
986.689,"this economy grow but we're also"
988.129,"going to make it fair"
989.929,"we're going to have more"
990.439,"advanced manufacturing jobs i"
992.179,"think we made a mistake years"
994.129,"ago when we eliminated what used"
995.959,"to be called vocational"
997.129,"education we've gotta return"
1003.759,"technical education to our high"
1006.129,"schools our community colleges"
1008.049,"there are right now more than a"
1010.779,"million jobs that can be filled"
1012.879,"by people who are machinist"
1014.559,"computer designers tool and die"
1016.869,"makers but for whatever reason"
1019.839,"they haven't been given the"
1021.16,"chance to get that training and"
1023.829,"maybe they've been told you know"
1025.179,"what the only future is to go to"
1027.789,"a great university like usf well"
1030.279,"that is true for a lot of people"
1031.48,"but it's not true for everybody"
1033.819,"and we need to make the hard"
1037.48,"work that builds America the"
1039.909,"kind of great work with respect"
1042.819,"and purpose that is going to"
1044.829,"attract a new generation"
1051.24,"that's why you'll read what i"
1052.95,"want to do in here we're gonna"
1054.72,"try to make Community College"
1056.37,"free"
1057.33,"we're also going to have"
1058.44,"apprenticeship programs i'm"
1060.09,"going to give a tax credit any"
1061.44,"company that is willing to pay a"
1063.51,"young person while that young"
1065.309,"person is learning that job at"
1068.13,"the same time so infrastructure"
1074.429,"advanced manufacturing clean"
1076.17,"renewable energy we can do this"
1078.54,"we are living off the"
1080.7,"investments that our parents and"
1082.41,"grandparents made it's time for"
1085.05,"us to step up and build"
1087.09,"America's future and let's make"
1089.46,"it fair while we do that"
1091.14,"that's why I've said we're going"
1092.88,"to emphasize the importance of"
1095.01,"small businesses right now small"
1097.26,"businesses are having a tough"
1098.28,"time in Florida and across"
1099.6,"America getting access to credit"
1102.3,"right and getting the kinds of"
1105.54,"regulations and overlapping"
1107.85,"expectations and standards that"
1111.42,"don't really make sense i want"
1113.7,"to make it clean and clear and i"
1115.559,"particularly want young people"
1116.7,"with an idea for a small"
1118.02,"business to feel that they can"
1119.7,"do it so I have proposed a"
1121.89,"moratorium for three years on"
1123.69,"student debt so you can actually"
1125.37,"get a business off the ground"
1126.9,"get it started"
1128.67,"make your future"
1133.68,"I also believe we should raise"
1137.04,"the national minimum wage"
1138.06,"anybody working full-time should"
1140.13,"not be living in poverty and"
1145.98,"finally let's guarantee equal"
1148.17,"pay for women's work which will"
1149.97,"raise a family and come"
1156.45,"anyone who's willing to work"
1158.01,"hard should have enough money to"
1159.84,"raise a family day but if you"
1161.58,"watch any of the Democratic"
1162.96,"convention"
1165.48,"well i don't know if you saw"
1167.13,"these two young people 17 years"
1169.38,"old from Kansas young man young"
1171.51,"woman went to the same high"
1174.27,"school about to be seniors get a"
1175.98,"summer job working at a pizza"
1177.33,"restaurant in their hometown"
1179.22,"they're pretty excited"
1181.29,"I remember when I had what I"
1182.25,"thought it was my first real job"
1183.51,"not babysitting not you know"
1186.33,"just kind of knocked around but"
1188.88,"a real job where i had to"
1190.02,"actually show up someplace and"
1191.52,"get a paycheck that was pretty"
1193.17,"exciting so young man young"
1195.39,"woman"
1197.04,"we're at our convention here's"
1198.33,"the story they told they were"
1200.4,"talking together one day after"
1201.84,"work they'd known each other and"
1204.81,"the young woman said you know"
1205.56,"i'm excited because i think i'm"
1208.14,"actually be able to save some"
1209.28,"money for college making eight"
1211.2,"dollars an hour and her friend"
1213.42,"young man looked at it goes i'm"
1215.73,"making 815 an hour and the young"
1220.17,"woman said well you didn't have"
1221.85,"any experience before this job"
1223.38,"doing this did you said no you"
1225.84,"know that didn't sit well what"
1228.6,"do you think happened"
1229.65,"don't get all must be a mistake"
1230.64,"today together and I give the"
1233.73,"young man a lot of credit"
1235.08,"goodguide right they go to tell"
1241.65,"the manager that there's been a"
1243.87,"mistake"
1244.74,"they're doing exactly the same"
1245.73,"job he's making 15 cents more an"
1248.55,"hour what happens the manager"
1251.82,"fired them both and you know"
1256.86,"what that's legal"
1258.03,"if you find out about somebody"
1260.34,"else's salary even if you're"
1261.93,"doing exactly the same job you"
1265.26,"can be retaliated against"
1266.67,"including being fired in most"
1268.14,"places so when I say let's have"
1270.33,"equal pay and some people I see"
1272.01,"looking quizzical at me is what"
1274.44,"course you got to have equal pay"
1276.72,"military and the pay scale is"
1279.03,"set or you're in the government"
1280.32,"and its set or you're under a"
1281.88,"union contract and it said"
1283.59,"but if you're in the vast"
1285.21,"majority of jobs in America you"
1287.22,"have no idea whether you're"
1288.6,"being paid fairly so we cannot"
1291.72,"let that continue that's wrong"
1293.7,"in America you're doing the job"
1295.62,"you deserve to get the pay and"
1302.19,"so how are we going to fund this"
1304.62,"well tell you we're going where"
1306.36,"the money is"
1307.409,"we're going to the people who've"
1309.059,"made the money in the last 15"
1310.86,"years"
1311.61,"we're going to the top one ten"
1314.34,"percent the millionaires the"
1316.11,"billionaire's they're gonna have"
1318.24,"to start paying for supporting"
1320.82,"our military supporting our"
1322.529,"education system supporting our"
1324.419,"healthcare system there could"
1330.179,"not be a bigger contrast between"
1332.85,"what I've proposed when it comes"
1334.77,"to taxes and what Donald Trump"
1337.23,"is proposed he actually has"
1340.26,"proposed giving trillions and I"
1342.27,"mean that with atty trillions in"
1344.94,"tax cuts to big corporations"
1347.159,"millionaires billionaires and"
1350.07,"wall street money managers that"
1354.059,"would not only explode our"
1355.77,"national debt it would lead to"
1357.96,"massive cuts in education and"
1360.149,"healthcare and many of his"
1362.13,"proposals would really benefit"
1364.83,"his own family but do nothing"
1367.59,"for the remaining 99 plus"
1369.96,"percent of americans and in fact"
1372.96,"independent analysts have said"
1376.32,"this they've looked at our plans"
1379.529,"he doesn't have much in the way"
1381.659,"of plans but they looked at what"
1382.98,"he said and they concluded if we"
1385.98,"did what Trump is recommending"
1387.809,"we would lose three and a half"
1389.22,"million jobs in four years if we"
1392.13,"do what I'm recommending we"
1394.169,"stand to gain over 10 million"
1395.789,"jobs in the next four years"
1398.83,"and among the things that I want"
1404.649,"to do is make sure we have an"
1407.08,"education system from early"
1409.51,"childhood through adulthood and"
1412.63,"that means i want universal"
1414.279,"pre-k I want to help more kids"
1416.799,"get a better start so that when"
1418.659,"they get to kindergarten first"
1420.159,"grade they're ready to learn"
1422.769,"I want to work with our teachers"
1424.12,"and educators I respect teachers"
1426.58,"and educators and I want to give"
1428.59,"them the support they need to do"
1430.72,"the job we asked and I want to"
1436.51,"support universities like this"
1438.73,"one here's one of the reasons"
1440.23,"why 50,000 students forty"
1444.909,"percent on pell grants a lot of"
1448.72,"people would never about an"
1449.799,"education if it weren't for the"
1451.12,"Federal Pell Grant program right"
1453.669,"but here's what's most"
1457.929,"impressive lot of schools have a"
1460,"lot of pell grants this"
1461.769,"university graduates all"
1465.039,"categories of students at the"
1466.899,"same rate if you're a Pell Grant"
1470.049,"student an on pell grants"
1472.389,"student if you're wide"
1473.919,"african-american latina latino"
1476.409,"asian everybody graduates at the"
1479.799,"same rate and why that happens"
1483.1,"is because this university makes"
1485.83,"a particular commitment to every"
1488.62,"student and moves as quickly as"
1491.799,"possible to help kids who maybe"
1494.59,"are first-generation college"

1508.49,"my mother had a really difficult"
1510.56,"childhood she never got to go to"
1512.15,"college so my dad couldn't"
1514.19,"really tell me much about going"
1515.81,"to college because he basically"
1517.19,"paid played football for four"
1518.87,"years and loved it"
1520.22,"my mom couldn't tell me so when"
1522.32,"I got to college I felt so out"
1524.63,"of place I was so nervous"
1527.18,"there used to be something way"
1528.86,"back in the dark ages called"
1530.33,"collect phone calls where you"
1535.97,"would call collect which meant"
1537.26,"that your parents had to pay for"
1538.34,"it and you just wait to see"
1541.34,"whether they accept it so I"
1544.49,"called home and I said I can't I"
1545.96,"can't do this it's too hard"
1548.39,"everybody here is smarter than I"
1549.86,"am they're better prepared than"
1551.33,"I am I want to come home and my"
1554.93,"father didn't want me to go so"
1556.25,"far away to school anyway he"
1558.71,"said come home"
1561.13,"my mother said no you have to"
1563.53,"stick it out and if you feel the"
1567.34,"same way at the end of the year"
1568.3,"then you can make a different"
1569.86,"decision course my mother was"
1571.09,"right i loved it"
1572.23,"within a month or two but I know"
1574.24,"what it feels like to show up"
1576.64,"and wonder can you make it"
1578.47,"are you good enough are you"
1579.82,"smart enough and thank goodness"
1583.33,"usf has people waiting to mentor"
1586.33,"and reassure and guide students"
1588.82,"every single college and"
1591.01,"university needs to have that"
1592.6,"and then we gotta make it"
1594.34,"affordable so kids don't have to"
1597.25,"leave because they no longer"
1598.6,"have the funding that they need"
1607.61,"and I want to do more in my"
1610.04,"effort to make childcare"
1611.809,"affordable no families to have"
1613.34,"to pay more than ten percent of"
1614.63,"your income on childcare and"
1617.42,"right now you have a lot of"
1619.37,"states where it costs more for"
1622.58,"childcare then tuition at"
1626.51,"college and university so i'm"
1628.91,"going to do I know you've got"
1629.87,"childcare here but as I told the"
1631.49,"president I want to do more to"
1632.75,"help you make sure every student"
1634.37,"parent has a safe place to bring"
1637.49,"their child while they're"
1638.63,"studying and working and trying"
1640.82,"to get their education and then"
1644,"we're going to help everybody"
1644.87,"with student debt how many of"
1646.22,"you have student debt"
1647.57,"we're going to help you pay it"
1650.48,"back and pay it off quickly"

1653.63,"rates down we're going to give"
1654.86,"you a new ways of paying it"

1679.97,"premiums co-pays deductibles and"
1682.309,"especially prescription drug"
1683.809,"costs"
1689.24,"and there are two other things"
1690.59,"were going to take on because"
1692.21,"I've heard about this all across"
1693.77,"America we're going to take on"
1696.74,"helping more people with mental"
1698.18,"health and addiction problems"
1700.1,"get the help you need"
1707.65,"so I'm excited about what we can"
1709.54,"do to create an economy and"
1711.61,"education and healthcare system"
1713.17,"that works and while we do it"
1715.42,"we're going to be protecting the"
1716.95,"rights of Americans all"
1718.93,"Americans we have fought too"
1720.49,"hard we've come too far and that"
1723.64,"means civil rights and it means"
1726.88,"women's rights and gay rights"
1728.47,"and voter rights and workers"
1731.14,"rights and disability rights"
1737.17,"and you know I i believe with"
1740.86,"all my heart because I've done"
1742,"this work my entire life looking"
1744.19,"at the disability sign there"
1746.29,"my first job out of law schools"
1747.94,"with the Children's Defense Fund"
1749.02,"I did a lot of interesting"
1751.66,"things and one of them was to"
1753.97,"gather evidence about why so"
1756.73,"many kids with disabilities were"
1758.29,"out of school there was no"
1759.94,"requirement that you went to"
1760.99,"school if you were blind deaf in"
1763.42,"a wheelchair and we change the"
1766.75,"law the first nation in the"
1768.25,"world to do that and I am so"
1770.71,"proud of our country so these"
1776.95,"rights are not for somebody else"
1778.6,"we all know somebody we all know"
1782.44,"woman we all know somebody in a"
1785.14,"racial or ethnic minority we all"
1789.01,"know a worker or a voter we all"
1792.4,"know a gay person and we all"
1794.44,"know somebody with a disability"
1795.97,"these are our rights and the"
1798.61,"kinds of things that you've been"
1800.08,"hearing from Donald Trump"
1801.52,"demeaning defaming groups of"
1804.91,"Americans people who have every"
1808.93,"right to be respected by someone"
1811.6,"who wants to be president the"
1812.65,"united states and he stands"
1814.66,"there and mocks a reporter with"
1816.52,"a disability and he calls women"
1819.16,"pics and he calls mexican"
1822.61,"immigrants rapists and criminals"
1824.29,"any demeans Muslims and attacks"
1829.84,"a gold star family whose son"
1832.75,"died and action in Iraq that's"
1835.93,"not who we are"
1837.31,"so yes we have a lot of plans"
1839.32,"but we also have values my"
1840.82,"friends and we're going to stand"
1842.71,"up for American values"
1848.19,"our book also outlines how we're"
1853.47,"going to keep our country safe"
1854.49,"from all threats"
1856.169,"we're gonna work with our allies"
1859.049,"not insult them"
1860.82,"we're going to stand up to our"
1862.649,"adversaries not cozy up to them"
1865.409,"we're going to have real plans"
1868.799,"not claims and secret plans this"
1873.779,"November the American people"
1875.49,"have a big choice to make when"
1876.69,"it comes to national security"
1878.46,"on the one hand we have Donald"
1880.379,"Trump"
1884.94,"who has called the American"
1886.47,"military a disaster"
1891.27,"who disrespects our military"
1893.79,"leaders by saying and I quote I"
1896.73,"know more about Isis than the"
1898.05,"generals do his companies and"
1902.58,"listen to this because I know"
1904.23,"there are a lot of veterans and"
1906.18,"lot of no active-duty people"
1907.74,"based here in Tampa his"
1910.26,"company's Trump companies have"
1913.14,"fired veterans because they had"
1916.41,"to take time off to fulfill"
1918.06,"their military commitments"
1922.26,"and we all saw him disparage the"
1925.65,"cons a gold star family lost"
1928.17,"their son and a car bomb"
1930.48,"explosion in Iraq as he ran"
1933.09,"toward it to prevent the loss of"
1935.22,"life of the people in his unit"
1939.06,"and saving hundreds of his"
1941.04,"fellow soldiers and when asked"
1943.98,"why he would insult a gold star"
1947.31,"family he suggested that his"
1950.91,"sacrifices are somehow"
1952.65,"comparable to theirs because he"
1956.37,"said and again I quote you can't"
1958.14,"make this up is that I work very"
1961.95,"very hard"
1963.54,"I've had tremendous success his"
1967.26,"whole campaign has been one long"
1970.56,"insult to all those who worn the"
1974.1,"uniform to protect our most"
1976.74,"cherished American values"
1982.99,"and a man who is so wrong about"
1985.63,"our veterans isn't right to"
1987.309,"serve as our commander-in-chief"
1988.69,"and when it comes to fighting"
1991.21,"Isis he has been all over the"
1993.55,"map"
1994.36,"you would have to literally map"
1996.37,"it out"
1998.05,"he's talked about letting Syria"
1999.61,"become a free zone for Isis look"
2002.79,"at the map Donald he's talked"
2007.71,"about sending in American ground"
2010.17,"troops"
2011.1,"not on my watch that is not what"
2013.14,"we are going to do"
2018.09,"he's even talked about using"
2021.27,"nuclear weapons"
2024.419,"he's very loose in his talk"
2026.58,"about nukes"
2028.049,"he says he doesn't care if other"
2030.059,"countries get them doesn't know"
2032.279,"why they haven't been used"
2033.21,"already"
2034.38,"I mean it's so mind-boggling"
2038.1,"when I hear these things i say"
2040.95,"that can't be true and then they"
2043.11,"replay it for me again"
2045.39,"he says he has a secret plan to"
2048.69,"defeat Isis but the secret is he"
2051.21,"has no plan"
2059.49,"after all his talk the only"
2062.7,"thing that is clear is he has no"
2064.83,"clue about what he's talking"
2066.72,"about and rather than work with"
2071.79,"our allies he chooses to insult"
2073.8,"them"
2075.33,"just last week in a few hours he"
2077.639,"managed to turn his trip to"
2079.08,"Mexico into an embarrassing"
2080.76,"international incident he got"
2083.55,"into a Twitter war with the"
2086.369,"President of Mexico he has"
2089.73,"temper mentally unfit and"
2091.74,"totally unqualified to be"
2093.51,"President of the United States"
2102.81,"as president I have a very"
2104.46,"different vision i will give our"
2107.46,"military everything they need"
2109.26,"when they're serving overseas i"
2111.36,"will support them with care and"
2113.07,"the benefits that they need and"
2114.48,"deserve when they come back home"
2116.67,"including job training and"
2119.1,"mental health care i will work"
2126,"closely with our allies not just"
2128.07,"to contain Isis but defeat them"
2130.65,"first to take out their"
2132.99,"stronghold in Iraq and Syria"
2135.24,"second we're going to dismantle"
2137.58,"their global terror"
2139.08,"infrastructure on the ground and"
2141.18,"online third we're going to"
2143.94,"bolster our defenses including"
2145.92,"with an intelligence surge to"
2148.44,"protect us and our allies we"
2150.45,"will do whatever is necessary"
2151.8,"for as long as it takes to bring"
2154.68,"Isis to justice and end their"
2156.9,"reign of terror once and for all"
2165.349,"and I will tell you this i am a"
2167.479,"very patient person I don't quit"
2171.47,"I don't give up I don't blink"
2174.68,"this sunday will be the 15th"
2180.349,"anniversary of the attack of 911"
2184.64,"I was a senator from New York I"
2188.93,"knew people who were killed"
2190.91,"I worked with families and the"
2193.16,"few survivors I work to get the"
2195.95,"health care needed by our first"
2197.599,"responders and emergency workers"
2199.849,"who ran for danger"
2206.34,"I worked to make our country"
2208.77,"safer and to rebuild New York"
2211.74,"and the Pentagon but I always"
2215.31,"always was determined to do"
2217.89,"anything I could to bring bin"
2219.54,"Laden to justice and thanks to"
2226.05,"the very patient painstaking"
2228.51,"work the American intelligence"
2230.4,"community"
2231.84,"finally when I was Secretary of"
2234.6,"State we were given the"
2237.15,"opportunity to evaluate the best"
2239.46,"evidence we had seen in a long"
2241.08,"time and I was honored to be"
2244.32,"part of that small group in the"
2245.85,"Situation Room advising"
2247.35,"President Obama as we went"
2249.51,"through the evidence over and"
2251.37,"over and over again trying to"
2253.83,"decide was incredible enough"
2255.99,"strong enough to take action and"
2259.02,"if we did what kind of action"
2260.58,"would it be a missile strike"
2262.17,"would be a bombing but it'd be"
2268.14,"an attack by Special Forces when"
2271.5,"it came time to go around the"
2272.91,"table"
2273.66,"these were all extremely"
2274.56,"experienced thoughtful experts"
2278.31,"we all gave our opinions i was"
2281.79,"one who said I thought it was"
2283.71,"worth the risk and I was"
2302.56,"and I was in that small"
2304.51,"situation room on that day you"
2308.17,"all know the story some of you"
2309.49,"read the book some of you have"
2310.57,"seen the movies but there's one"
2311.59,"thing i want to tell you because"
2312.73,"it demonstrates again what our"
2318.07,"values are as Americans remember"
2321.61,"Donald Trump is said he would"
2323.71,"order American troops to torture"
2325.33,"he would order American troops"
2327.85,"to murder family members of"
2329.53,"terrorists that's what you said"
2332.59,"heedless of the consequences but"
2335.74,"that would lead to in terms of"
2337.39,"putting Americans all over the"
2339.13,"world and even greater risk but"
2341.89,"here's what happened that night"
2342.82,"in Pakistan this is not an often"
2346.66,"told part of the story I want to"
2348.76,"tell you particularly young"
2349.93,"people here particularly active"
2352.36,"duty military veterans like Mary"
2355.87,"if you saw any of the"
2358.81,"reenactment you know that one of"
2361.72,"the helicopters clipped its tail"
2363.76,"as was going in to the courtyard"
2365.65,"on the wall it disabled that"
2368.62,"helicopter now thankfully every"
2371.2,"contingency had been thought"
2373.36,"through and so we were prepared"
2377.56,"for that the military was"
2378.88,"prepared they could get another"
2380.56,"helicopter there to take out the"
2382.15,"seals who are going to have to"
2383.83,"blow up the disabled helicopter"
2386.41,"after rushing into the compound"
2389.11,"taking out the two bodyguards"
2391.81,"taking out the lines adult son"
2394.18,"taking out bin Laden they knew"
2398.77,"they had to get out of there at"
2401.35,"any time it could have been"
2402.61,"Pakistani military wondering"
2404.11,"what's going on something's"
2405.79,"happening"
2406.63,"this was a military garrison"
2408.43,"town so time was really precious"
2413.35,"but here's what the seals did"
2415.81,"before they blew that out that"
2419.26,"helicopter up they took out all"
2421.9,"the women and children family"
2425.74,"members of terrorists including"
2428.38,"the worst terrorist of all they"
2432.76,"took them out of the compound"
2435.5,"around the back to safety before"
2439.46,"they blew that helicopter that"
2442.37,"Donald Trump is what American"
2444.53,"honor slide"
2455.089,"i want to mention just three"
2456.589,"other threats one threat here"
2459.38,"right at home"
2460.759,"the epidemic of gun violence and"
2463.13,"we have got to have"
2464.119,"comprehensive background checks"
2466.19,"close the gun show loophole"
2467.989,"close the online loophole and"
2471.41,"and the ability of people on the"
2474.259,"terrorist watch list buying a"
2476.45,"gun in America this agenda I"
2482.059,"just briefly outlined is"
2483.469,"supported by a vast majority of"
2485.18,"Americans and a vast majority of"
2487.579,"American gun owners and it's"
2489.68,"time we all said in one voice"
2493.519,"hey we can respect the Second"
2496.4,"Amendment we can respect the"
2498.319,"right to own arms but we don't"
2500.839,"want people who shouldn't have"
2501.92,"guns in the first place killing"
2503.509,"anybody else ever again"
2512.48,"another threat to our country is"
2514.76,"climate change 2015 was the"
2517.73,"hottest year on record in the"
2519.26,"science is clear"
2521.3,"it's real it's wreaking havoc on"
2524.119,"communities across America last"
2525.89,"week's hurricane was another"
2528.05,"reminder of the devastation that"
2529.88,"extreme weather can cause and I"
2531.53,"send my thoughts and prayers to"
2533.75,"everyone affected by her me but"
2536.78,"this is not the last one that's"
2538.34,"going to hit Florida given"
2540.47,"what's happening in the climate"
2542.06,"nobody knows that better than"
2544.55,"folks right here in Tampa and in"
2546.59,"the broader region sea levels"
2549.619,"have been rising here about an"
2552.26,"inch per decade since the"
2554.63,"nineteen fifties at the rate we"
2557.66,"are going by 2030 which is not"
2561.05,"that far away 70 billion dollars"
2567.05,"of coastal property in this"
2569.119,"state will be flooding at high"
2572,"tide and whenever our"
2575.57,"infrastructure is threatened so"
2577.64,"to as our homeland security the"
2580.76,"next president will have to work"
2582.38,"with communities like campus to"
2585.05,"prepare for future storms when"
2588.02,"i'm in the Oval Office i'm going"
2589.4,"to work with local leaders to"
2591.92,"make smart investments in"
2593.96,"infrastructure to help protect"
2595.31,"regions from fun flooding and"
2598.1,"other effects of climate change"
2601.1,"I'm going to continue to work on"
2602.119,"the international and national"
2603.05,"level to try to turn the clock"
2606.95,"back to stabilize and reduce"
2610.369,"emissions even more to try to"
2612.44,"gain more time but we're going"
2613.88,"to have to begin working"
2615.02,"immediately on mitigation and"
2616.91,"resilience and prevention as"
2619.43,"well"
2621.68,"and what about Donald Trump well"
2625.04,"he doesn't even believe in"
2626.12,"climate change he says it's a"
2627.38,"hoax invented by the Chinese and"
2630.2,"he says quote you can't get hurt"
2632.69,"with extreme weather now this is"
2635.81,"the same guy who at one of his"
2637.58,"golf courses in some coastal"
2639.29,"place has demanded that all see"
2642.02,"we'll all be built to protect"
