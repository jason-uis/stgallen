Gambling may be a riskier way to grow your bitcoins if you're able to make some profits out of gambling.nope, in fact many people also make gambling as a primary way to grow their bitcoin,although risky, it is still a way to grow bitcoin,If you believe them then they either lied to you or they even lie to themselves.Check out the chats on the dice sites. All the regular gamblers lost money over time. It happens rarely that someone goes with big wins. And the more often you play the higher plays mathematics it's brutal law. You will lose.So no, gambling is never a way to grow your bitcoin when you start with the intention of growing it. It is a sure way to lose your money.An exception only are games where you can get an advantage in chances. Like poker or counting cards.Yes that is right. I find gambling more like if you want some excitement or needed some time to chill. But growing it through that? that is too riskyyou're right if you want excitement you can invest your money, but gamble is not the way to grow your coins, even if theres a risk in investing , if you ask someone which is better they would say its better to invest than to gamble.",11,1,2015,11_1_2015

But if you want to take the safe path, just make a research on different types of companies (involving Bitcoin) before making an investment. Then, you could be sure to invest, take the risk and earn a decent amount of money which will make your Bitcoins grow for days to come. Just my opinion.  It's not easy though since in oder to scam money you have to put an investment too in your beloved scam tool to get more customers in investors in case of a building a ponzi site or any investment scheme. It requires good build and unique script of that site too. Stealing money is hard too because it requires good planning. If you will rob a bank you must have guns or anything as your weapon and you need a team for this. You will scout first the bank and the route you will follow as your escape route. Also have a vehicle which is also quiet expensive if you buy a second hand or a 10% healthy car. If stealing on a single person, you need to analyze the movement of that person inluding the time when alone or time of work etc. What a discussion is this lol. What do you mean? The easiest scam is to ask for a loan without collateral. It works way too often. Or offering your bitcointalk forum account as collateral with the intent to default so that the loaner has to sell it.Most scams don't need any investment. Only if you want to scam a big thing you might need some investment upfront. But when you think about neobee then it seems it might be possible to scam only with the promise of future profits. And people will invest.Lol someone take my post seriously huh. It's a funny scene.  The easiest type of scam you are talking in the first part of your reply is really a shit type lol. Who dumb people will take a bait easily for a no collateral loan type. Even offering a bitcointalk account is not working anymore to get a scam. So that is not the easiest. It's already 2016 and that type of transaction will just caught a 1 yr old boy or even less than.And on the second part of your post, that's what Im pointing out in my funny scene post lol. Sometimes it needs invesment to have a better scam program like the one who are making ponzis.",11,3,2015,11_3_2015

I tried that the last time and it worked for me.  Can you tell me your current progress in Hashnest?You said the word ""easily"". Didn't you know that buying hashrate from any cloudmining scheme doesn't guarantee you an easy bitcoin. Factors are prices volatility, mining difficulty etc. It's a sure earning (at least for today) but ""easy"" is not the right term here.Well, all I do is analyze the hashrates for sale at Hashnest. I just go to the sidebar and click Hash. There I could see the different types of hashrate available from different miners such as Ant S3, S5, S7, etc. I mainly choose to buy S5 and S7 hashrate. Then, I go to the market tab and click ""more"" located at the lower left corner of the page. There you could see buy and sell orders for that type of miner's hashrate. I just analyze the different prices and hashrate available for purchase. For example, if someone is selling 100 Gh/s for 0.25 BTC, but there is another 100 Gh/s hashrate available for sale at a cheaper price, (for less BTC) I buy it and wait for a couple of weeks (checking the prices daily) and look for other types of 100 Gh/s hashrate for sale. If the available hashrate is more expensive (the same 100 Gh/s) than what I bought it, I sell mine for a little bit more BTC (and taking in consideration it is still cheaper than the posted hashrate) and profit from it.Hope this helps. If you need anything else, please let me know.  Thanks for the explanation mate. I got your point the time you posted it out but I see it's not an easy one like you said.It will take time because everyday you can't see selling a cheap one. That method is called marketing method for example in some online games that has market option. Buy cheap sell high Same name.

I tried that the last time and it worked for me.  Can you tell me your current progress in Hashnest?You said the word ""easily"". Didn't you know that buying hashrate from any cloudmining scheme doesn't guarantee you an easy bitcoin. Factors are prices volatility, mining difficulty etc. It's a sure earning (at least for today) but ""easy"" is not the right term here.Well, all I do is analyze the hashrates for sale at Hashnest. I just go to the sidebar and click Hash. There I could see the different types of hashrate available from different miners such as Ant S3, S5, S7, etc. I mainly choose to buy S5 and S7 hashrate. Then, I go to the market tab and click ""more"" located at the lower left corner of the page. There you could see buy and sell orders for that type of miner's hashrate. I just analyze the different prices and hashrate available for purchase. For example, if someone is selling 100 Gh/s for 0.25 BTC, but there is another 100 Gh/s hashrate available for sale at a cheaper price, (for less BTC) I buy it and wait for a couple of weeks (checking the prices daily) and look for other types of 100 Gh/s hashrate for sale. If the available hashrate is more expensive (the same 100 Gh/s) than what I bought it, I sell mine for a little bit more BTC (and taking in consideration it is still cheaper than the posted hashrate) and profit from it.Hope this helps.

Can anyone shine some light on it for me?I think your amount has to be picked in order for it to gain real interest. Does that mean that your cash just sits there without making any profits most of the time?So in short people that want to trade on margin need to borrow either btc or usd for the trade.  You supply the btc for example, there is a market buy/sell btc rates.  so you can say I want to buy btc for 2 days at 0.002% per day, and some other guy would say I want to sell btc for 2 days at 0.003% per day.  So I suppose your cash sits there no earning anything is no one buys your order.  You can say I will lend for 30 days also I think.  Hope that explains it a bit.

If you have balance, I think the price may fall a little without you being margin called.And Clam is always falling, so I think what you get with Just Dice is not worth the loss by the fall of the price.

They just promote new comers in bitcoins and nothing else, it's safe because of zero investment but it's too much low paying. It's worthless.Secondly, trading - now payment here is variable, you may get loss or profit depending upon rates.. It's risky as it involves investment.Thirdly, mining--  Mining involves large investment and pays high too, but you may get loss depending on certain factors..Fourthly, Signature campaigns-- No investments needed and it's pays high too.

Theres a new one coming up which I cant remember the name off my head, it was featured in some crypto news site sorry sir, i think holding is also growing your bitcoin, we can say it longterm investment, im holding my bitcoin to paper wallet, and i sure it will growing in futureI too believe in bitcoin value appreciations. Because by investing bitcoin we may grow our bitcoins and may not in some cases. Saving bitcoins from signature campaign and buying with my regular job is the only ways I do follow to grow my bitcoins.Indeed better and safest ways to grow your bitcoins. But I feel these are passive way of growing bitcoins when I have more free time to gamble and to try in bitcoin trading to grow my bitcoins rapidly and actively. But there are more risks and always profits is not guaranteed.Yes active methods are always has some risks. If you are not expert in your active methods then your active methods may turn negative methods to wipe out all your savings. Slow and steady is the better method I believe in. I grow my bitcoins using signature campaign and faucet earnings.",12,6,2015,12_6_2015

We believe farmsatoshi, coinbrawl, cannonsatoshi, coinkingdoms are the best faucet games. Always remember to check if the faucet require an investment (it means it is a higher risk for scam). Also check minimum withdrawal and withdrawal fee (Some faucets have minimum withdrawal of 100.000-300.000 satoshis which is very high for a faucet) and som faucets have a fee of 30.000-50.000 for withdrawal which is very high.Other ways is to invest is Bter?s investment program which yield daily interest (10-12 % on yearly basis).

Pointless waste of time. For you faucets may be a waste of time, and to a certain point, you are right. Only look at the amount of traffic these faucet sites get. A lot! These people don't consider it a waste of time.Well I'm not sure how many other people consider faucets a waste of time, aren't the ""people"" who are using these faucets typically bots or people who are extremely new when it comes to Bitcoin?I used to use faucets something like 2 years ago, and once I saw it took 3 months to earn the same amount of pennies, I ended up looking for alternative methods, and eventually stumbled across this board. Then I discovered signature campaigns.I guess that some people would still use faucets kind of like how I used them, but I can't fathom how they would still have such high traffic.That is why faucets owners are getting broked because of this bot. They also want profit the same as the one who gets free satoshis using their faucet. It is not that large profit for them too. That is why they cant pay that much for faucets and also because of those bots that is why they dont pay a large quantity. They need some time also for their sites to be viewed.",12,8,2015,12_8_2015

There is little known and popular currencies in the world market. The same will happen with alt coins, but after a rigorous selection. Garbage coin just die. I do not think that Bitcoin to be a most popular crypto currency in a few years. Already, the problem starts with the Bitcoin transactions (they are too slow and their number is limited - only 7 transactions per second) So do not blindly believe in the only single btc  well bitcoin can solve its weakness with sidechain in the future, so why we need altcoin when thaat point will coem true?i see no reason and that's why many altcoin will die, and only the nostalgic one will survive, or those that offer a completely new thing, like maidsafe and ethereum..maybe...",12,10,2015,12_10_2015

I think investing in Bitcoin at present for this price is much more dangerous.Investing in rare coins with a small number of coins in the system is less risky than investing in shares that prints any governmental organization.i can't see how bitcoin is more unsecure than any altcoin, every alt aside from litecoin, that was in top 10, it's now in the trash can forgottenthe other that are holding still strong are doge and peercoin, the remaining have lost a big portion of their value, and most likely they will not recoveron the other hand bitcoin is recovering nicely, i believe that when bitcoin will be adopted more the other alt will all die in no timehow could  altcoins die? Many altcoins have good user base, active developer teams, abundant useful features like NXT, BTS, ETH Ripple etc! They are all priced in Bitcoin! The price movement  correlates with Bitcoin! Bitcoin price is up, atcooin will drop down! Like Dollar and gold! I don't think you points make any sense! Probably some shit altcoins will not survive.",12,10,2015,12_10_2015

You need to be convinced that these are safe investments. Otherwise it is asking for getting scammed. Unfortunately i tried to spread risk too and what should i say... even though i would have sworn on at least one project everyone of them turned out to be bad apples. Diversification does not help much only for that reason.At the end if you have slight doubts then DON'T invest at all. It is way better to have 100% coins than the promise to have 200% coins in a years timeframe.

I do not recommend it either because of high chances losing your coins.

I think in 5-6 ponzis that I used to play with, there's always one (sometimes two) that will live for only a day.

Perhaps more conservative routes like faucets, simply purchasing, holding, or investing.holding is definitely not growing your bitcoins. Anyway, try saving wallets like haobtc or Magnr. Theres a new one coming up which I cant remember the name off my head, it was featured in some crypto news site sorry sir, i think holding is also growing your bitcoin, we can say it longterm investment, im holding my bitcoin to paper wallet, and i sure it will growing in futureHow can it be growing? You will still have the same amount of bitcoins after all that time. Only the fiat value of these bitcoins can be higher maybe. But the question was about growing bitcoins which means, in my opinion, to have more bitcoins than before at the end.It's why i have programmed a system where one have more bitcoin at the end than at the start.But what do then people here?the do not analyse my system...they say just:PONZI.So far my first investors have made good profit.The next ones will do as well.I'm not here to convince you...I'm just here to inform you.After 100 days all is clear...one can see that I was right and my detractors wrong.The ones who invested have more btc (satoshi) than at the start.The non-investor have the same than at the start.What should I do more and why?No reason to do more:because my fun is reached...I have programmed a system and if one person invest in it is enoughif zero person invest in it it does not matter...the few satoshi made by the system go in my poket.No matter what happens...I have my fun.It's not about the first investors. First investors in a ponzi or pyramid game often have more than before. It is about the last investors who will lose everything or most of their investment when the game collapses because no new investors can be found.Next thing is, are the numbers backed at all when everyone wants to withdraw? A website can show all stats it wants, but that doesn't necessarely mean that the funds really exist.1)...I see you publish sign campaign...are you sure that you are paid and if the funds to pay you exist?you can not be sure...and even if you are sure it does not mean that the funds exist and even if they exist you are perhaps not paid.Yes, because i only take part in sig campaigns where collateral funds are held by independent escrows. So even when they run i will get paid.Quote from: winspiral on December 12, 2015, 01:10:03 PM2)...it is not because my first  investors are paid like in ponzi sheme that it does mean that it is a ponzi seme.The first ones are paid because (95 to 100) days are passed...Then do you have a link where the system you mean is explained? Then i can see if it really is different from a normal ponzi.Quote from: winspiral on December 12, 2015, 01:10:03 PM3)...I have already said 100 or more times that the system does not need new investors to pay old ones.Investors are always paid...and profit as well if dividends have been paid...so far:And where come the additional coins from?Quote from: winspiral on December 12, 2015, 01:10:03 PMQuoteNumber of dividends after 16 september 2015: 3936it is very unprobale that no more dividends will be paid in the future.The system can only collapse if after 100 days no investment is done.But then all investors have been paid before.Fully paid so that they got their investment back? Sounds like a magic money creation machine. Early investors have more than they invested and later investors at least got their investment back? Where comes the additional money from?Quote from: winspiral on December 12, 2015, 01:10:03 PM4)...people do not want to wisdraw...investors are parly paid out regularly by the system...it's made by me manually.Why should I invent datas...i have no more or no less profit doing so.Have you read somewhere that what was published was wrong?I'm sure the website will show that they own a lot. And i'm sure with the coins invested you can pay out the dividends for some time. Though the question is if everyone can withdraw everything they invested plus the dividends at the same time.Quote from: winspiral on December 12, 2015, 01:10:03 PM5)...I publish that the ""funds"" about you tall are:QuoteInvestment in system = 0.0152641410Do you really believe that 0.015BTC can not exist?Have you at least taken the time to be able to talk about seriously or do you just talk about to show your ""signature""?It seems so sorry...Oh, that actually is not much. I thought it must have been more invested. Doesn't look like you can profit from it at all then.And no, i did not read about your system yet, that's why i asked about a link. I only know how hyip's and pyramid games/snowball systems work.you can learn about here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1171677.0This system has cost me ""negative trust points"" and scammer name...it's why i'm hurt when one talk about in a wrong way...QuoteThe most important in this story is not to know from where are the satoshi.I can myself not know exactly from where they come from.The study of this ""origine"" would take me too much time and time is money.The most important is that my satoshi tree is productive.Compared to ponsi and other investment system we have a big difference.I do promise NOTHING more that:1)return of the principal in less than 100 days (this is in my possibilities)2)sending a dividend (this is in my possibilities too because I have promised nothing fixed)My system is not only a investment site:it's as well a game:the game consists to gamble of investments and reinvestments.To be honest...i do not know how much dividends will be paid.If we know in advance it is not funny(over all if the dividends are small)(lol)After reading this i can understand you rating. You await that you come out with unknown origins of the coins and not being suspect of being a scammer? And then you say it is a gamble of investment. Which includes losing.Sorry but it was a pretty good sign for scammers in the past when they had ominous earnings whose origin they could not explain.In fact i think there is the possibility that you earn from advertising a bit but with the height of investment it might be still viable, but not for bigger amounts anymore. You would need many customers with small amounts for that.So for the moment i can not see that it is a legit business venture.",12,14,2015,12_14_2015

And in fact they received more money than selling the account themselfes would have gained them. Plus they safed some work.Though i think even altcoins as collateral are not really safe. I think a loaner could buy altcoins he think will rise in worth and receive bitcoins for them as a loan, giving the altcoins as collateral.

According to me The first is safe (for the meaning which might have this word about the online opportunities). Has 5 years online and 9 years of development. Always correct with everything. More than 4 million us dollar invested and more than 6 million us dollar withdrawals. More than 52 000 investors. Hundred or representants in to many countries. A sea of data in the website which give every kind of needed data about their activity.The second one is with medium risk as for me. It is correct with everything, has a very professional site but has only one month life. Only this last data make me to classify it with medium risk. Because there is not any other kind that make me think that this opportunity can be risky.The third one is considered by me as an investment with high risk. I am investing in a new crypto only guessing (from several signs I have noted and supposed) that the price of this crypto (actually very low) will go better. Hope much better but even better it will be enough.",12,16,2015,12_16_2015

If it works than works rightI did not say gambling, I think I also have a negative balance with gambling  (I lost 0.1 playing blackjack, not sure how much I have won but it is certainly below what I lost). What I suggested is investing in some site's bankroll and getting a commission out of it (assuming no one gets lucky enough to ~empty the bankroll). You see, most people have lost with gambling, then, been at the other side seems safer. Of course you have to choose carefully, a well established site with good history (it is a trade-off, though, because there you will probably have a lower share in the profits than in newer sites, it depends on how much risk you can tolerate). There are also risks involved, besides the whale-factor I already mentioned, there is a possibility of the site been hacked or the owner running away with the funds (this would be less likely to happen with a well-known site owned by a reputable person, in my opinion).Quote from: harizen on December 18, 2015, 02:52:19 PMYeah I invested some as a test in just-dice.

This rise in price is dependent on the supply and the demand.  Think of it like this, if you have 1,000,000 bitcoin in circulation and you are selling a bobber for 1,000 BTC, you could only ever sell 1,000 bobbers before all the BTC in circulation has been used.  When this happens and people really need your bobbers, they will pay more for that BTC in order to get that bobber.  This is the same strategy we need to incorporate the same theory into the general public.  We need retail establishments to start accepting BTC as a form of payment.  The more people that accept this as a form of Payment, the more the coin will be needed and thus the price will increase.Exactly. And the more rare the coin is, the more demand and in effect this would result in price increase. We need more physical stores to accept Bitcoins and major businesses and companies like Walmart, Sears, Target and other big merchants.

Alternatively , the loanee can also give the account credentials to a reputable escrow if he can't trust the lender.What is stopping loanee from doing a password reset through email? I took forum accounts into escrow for loans too. I received the login, then i change the password and set a random email address. Bitcointalk isn't sending emails out to verify such change. And i delete possible security questions.Then the account should be safe.But be very cautious that you don't get a hacked account. Only when the loaner can provide a signature that is safe to say that the account belongs to him, then you can use the account.Next thing is, don't overestimate the price of accounts. The prices drop constantly. Often enough accounts are given as collateral only for the reason to not having to sell them. The loaner gets the loan and vanishes with it. The lender then has the work to sell the account.",12,23,2015,12_23_2015

It's the best way to earn, on this forum at least.yeah signature campaign is the easiest job with a large income, but whether it can be made in the long term for this job?thinking againsignature campaign really possible to be a full income?I think it is possible especially to people living on a third world country. I think I should also consider sig campaign as a source of my income coz I am just working with sig campaign right now since I am only a student .PS: I am also living on a third world country and I can say earnings on a sig campaign was enough for weekly expenses but I won't depend my living on a posting job online yes it looks with your activities in this forum I saw more than 3 of your post for this page only yes true earnings in sign campaign is big enough, but important thing not too dependent on this job broOf course I won't depend too much on sig campaigning alone. Its just that it was the easiest yet fun and educational way to earn ""money"" and its perfect for me as a student coz I can post anytime I want (only on my free time though). But I will still do sig campaign when I get  a job in the future, hope it still exist Firstly I used to feel that only faucets are paying in peanuts but now same goes with signature campaigns too, as it doesn't gives you the best earnings as it is just an passive income and it doesn't guarantee you the future security, if you want to earn big then think big, afford to take risks, more risks more returns, so I believe if you want to grow your bitcoins in quick time then gambling and trading are the key to success.Actually I am investing on HYIPs or ponzis right now to make ""big"" profit which I think has the highest risk but with high returns. And about what you've said that either gambling or trading is the key to success, I do agree with that but it was never recommended no non-risk takers and to those wants to earn safely.",12,29,2015,12_29_2015

Getting a job and separating 10 to 20% of your earnings to invest it on Bitcoin is a clever idea. Besides, after doing this you will earn much when the next halving comes and the price goes up. This would be the best interest rate when compared to banks. You would grow your Bitcoins and your profits if you do this. Also, if you take advantage of Bitcoin's price volatility, you can certainly make them grow. Just sharing my opinion. ",12,29,2015,12_29_2015

Thanks to this, im making a modest but nice portfolio. Everything else is too much luck involved.Yes that is definitely the fastest and easiest way to grow your Bitcoins. Getting a job and separating 10 to 20% of your earnings to invest it on Bitcoin is a clever idea. Besides, after doing this you will earn much when the next halving comes and the price goes up. This would be the best interest rate when compared to banks. You would grow your Bitcoins and your profits if you do this. Also, if you take advantage of Bitcoin's price volatility, you can certainly make them grow. Just sharing my opinion.  Yeah that is right, keep on earning or buying bitcoins and keep it safe for the future as the price of bitcoins is surely gonna reach to a next level in the coming months and when you feel that you are making profits sell part of your bitcoins and rest keep it for future and rebuy when the price falls down as we all know that bitcoin is too volatile so why not to take advantage of volatility.",12,30,2015,12_30_2015

I believe i lost something above 100 USD when liberty reserve went down too.So far the only hyip i know that went for a couple of years was uinvest. But i checked now and it seems it finally ended now too. With a scam... not surprisingly. See: https://www.facebook.com/UInvestRipOffSince they were so long in the business i already thought they do something different, like being a website fromu ukrainian mafia to wash black money but it seems they were only a plain scam too.I did not really take part at that time, i checked out hyip's some years ago before bitcoin came up, i earned only a bit of money from trading shares there.At the end i thought this is way too fishy. The profits the projects they sold should have brought, additionally to pay back the investors, would have been way way too high even for a normal business that doesn't have to pay back a loan. It was simply stupid to trust them. Though i know that over time many put all their lifesavings into, and that weren't only 10k of usd often.Well, hyip's are always a bad idea, even when you think you can beat the system by investing as the first and withdrawing so that you can get out without losing... there will always come a time when all hyips only live for 2 days or so and instantly default. I never met one who could make money with that over a longer time. They lose always at one point in time. It's really nothing to bet on.",1,1,2016,1_1_2016

It is a really bad idea unless you have mastered algorithms and card counting. Gambling is not like the movie 21 anymore where card counting is illegal and you can earn tons from it. You won't earn that much and it's a waste of brain energy. Do something else like studying how the market rises in Bitcoin worth day by day to the point where you can actually predict when Bitcoin will grow a certain amount in whichever currency you work with based on what country you live in.,1,3,2016,1_3_2016

I also been ripped off on BTCjam before and I never go back to the site anymore. Lending on this forum will be better coz you can ask for a valid collateral which can help if ever the borrower will default on its loan.i dont think lending is good way maybe if you meet the person face to face but here i would skip it still good method is mining and signature camp and offering servicesAsking a valid collateral will be your guarantee that you won't lose on lending here, even on strangers. Its not necessary to meet up with the person you are lending for some bitcoin. Anyways if you still don't think its a good way, I respect your opinion everyone has his or her opinion mine is that lending is not good way some bad personally experience with friends and dont like lending money or anything to anyone",1,6,2016,1_6_2016

But besides this, I think that creating your own alt coin could be very profitable if you do it right with no ninja launch and with truly unique features. Just look at Ethereum, it just started last year and now it is a very successful coin. It is listed as #4 in market cap on Coinmarketcap.

There are options to earn as well but I find that kinda slowAs the bitcoin's price is rising nowadays holding the coins could be profitable method to growing up our bitcoins, you can also building your account in this forum and reaching good rank and joining the signature campaign there to make some extra incomeHolding can't increase the quantity of your coins. Ups or down in the price, still the number of your coins will remain the same. To really enjoy the price uptrend, increase your hold coins with any method you know.correct.. I am still confused. why do people still mention like that. holding is a method for growing. whereas holding didn't increase the quantity of your bitcoin.For a long term holding, in the point of the coins are just stored in a cold or paper storage, it can't really grow their bitcoin but rather it's value when there's a pump.For a short term holding, coins can grow by doing trades then do another holding if the price went to dip. This is so called a 'go long' and 'go short'.Ya only grow value in another currency not grow their bitcoin..ya true perhaps by holding altcoin and sell when prices rise. It also includes growing bitcoin. right?",1,10,2016,1_10_2016

Expecting a price kick for those new coins? Didn't you know that exchanging them in an exchange site is much better than renting rigs to mine other alts others than bitcoin. Face the real thing and don't do the usual thing in the past.And fyi, as marco said, bitx has no longer provides cloudmining.The answer are the first seconds. It's a gamble again though. But there are people that try to get their miners run the first seconds when mining starts. If they are lucky then they can find some blocks with having a relatively low hashrate. The hashrate will rise only after more miners jump on mining that coin. So if you are lucky then you can earn some bit.But i think too many are trying that already.",1,13,2016,1_13_2016

But if you study it, have the right tools, then it is calculated risk. Profit is big. There is still the risk to loose but very minimal.Yup! if you can get the right tools in calculating and study the movement it will be effective with trading like you said the profit is big and in often times you will need luck in every move you make, the risk is there also so be very careful. Minimal losing is like for the owner to decide. If he sees that your profit are getting larger he will make you lose. And of course are minds are set to get it back. Then you lose again until the time where they get all your profit and somehow you just realized that you are losing a lot too.He wrote about trading, you about gambling.

The profit comes from the gamblers losing and from staking on top. For testing purposes you can invest a small amount only too.By the way, you can set your investment so that you claim that you invested 100 times more than you actually really have. That way your risk is rising when big bets are played but also your chance of winning bigger parts of the house profits are rising.You only need to have a look at the bitcoin price because clams hold their value and are traded in bitcoin. So that when the bitcoin price is dropping and clam price normally stays the same, then your claims are worth less fiatwise. Of course when bitcoin is rising then your value goes up additionally.You can check it out with a small amount and let it lay there for a month. Set it to /offsite max in the chat so that you have 100 times more invested than you have too. Then check out the results.",1,16,2016,1_16_2016

(despite what other posters may say while promoting their services, all forms of investment carry risk - Magnr included)In the early days of my involvement, I bought an initial $100 of btc @ $2 a piece. I traded this up using technical analysis and arbitrage into $200k which I invested into building out Magnr's trading platform. My goal for the trading platform? Allow my remaining bitcoins to be lent out to other traders on margin so that I could charge a daily interest rate to them. Just like that, I created a mechanism for me to generate interest returns in a very passive way. (in reality it is far from passive because I need to manage the trading platform now... thats another story though)After the trading platform was launched [initially as BTC.sx - Coindesk article on us], it grew fast and eventually the demand for leveraged trading exceeded my ability to lend.Magnr Savings was born (Bitcoin Magazine article on us). To continue serving our leveraged traders, we decided to set up Magnr Savings. This allows those who are comfortable with the risks involved to deposit their Bitcoins and let our traders use their bitcoins for short term leveraged positions.Magnr Savings pays out a 2.35% annual interest rate on a maximum of 100 btc. We manage the risks internally and our clients have never lost a satoshi. Our goal is to keep it that way as all of our staff also use the service .Here is our post in the Service Announcement sub-forum:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1299830.0To be transparent (I appreciate that BitcoinTalk loves transparency), the risks involved in using Magnr Savings are counterparty risk to Magnr as a company.

Look like you are in bitcoin trading for a long time and just hiding in that newbie account. Where do you place your trades? Maybe we can share some useful ideas and tips too.I second the motion. I would really love too here that too. Been here around but havent seen anyone telling where they trade, some just dont want their secrets revealed.I doubt anyone is willing to reveal their trading strategies if their strategies is profitable for them.My BTC trading strategies are generally profitable, and I do not mind sharing some of my general btc trading strategies; however, ultimately, each person needs to gain experience by practice and by building up his/her trading positions.  If you do not want to trade BTC by pure luck, which is a form of gambling, and you want to have some fairly certain long term profits, then you place your bets in ways that are more secure and the profits are smaller and you work on locking in your profits slowly and in small increments and in this practice there is no free lunch, even though once you take some of your btc trade positions, you may witness very large price movements in one direction or another that you are already in an established position to take advantage of such large price movements and accordingly to take larger than expected profits because of that large price movement.  Ultimately, the idea is to attempt to trade btc securely and with profits and continuously build staggered trade positions on both the buying and selling sides and to have those positions be small and profitable all the way up and down the line.  In this regard, you do not attempt to predict the price and you buy BTC on the way down and sell on the way up.This BTC trading strategy will work with any amount of total BTC holdings, and the more capital that you have to employ towards the systematic approach, then the greater the potential profits, but even if you start out with smaller amounts than those amounts described herein, the number of BTC and dollars in your trading portfolio can be built and expanded over time and sticking with the same trading strategy described herein will likely build and expand the number of your coins ... as you are learning from your BTC trading practices and watching the BTC trading market.Let's say hypothetically that over the years, you have accumulated 20 bitcoins into your trading portfolio (currently that is worth about $8,000), and maybe you have about $2,000 in cash... So for round numbers and argument sake you have a total value of $10,000 in your btc trading portfolio (yes the same principles would apply whether you have a total portfolio of $100 or a total of $1 million as well). Accordingly,  .... With your current position and allocation of 20 btc which quantities will change with your taking new positions, each time BTC prices go up by $1, you have approximately $20 of profit on paper. More or less, with a BTC  price of around $400, I personally set my trade authorizations in either $5 or $10 price increments depending on my anticipation of the speed of the BTC price movements and whether I believe that the price is going to change from going in one direction towards the opposite direction.  Even though I hold varying expectations that the short term BTC price will move in one direction or another, I don't attempt to predict with any certainty regarding those short term btc price directions, and I just hope that over the long term BTC  prices will be going up and my trading strategies are thus designed to continue to accumulate more BTC and don't necessarily require the adding of additional dollars towards building more bitcoins. Even though I may trade in $5 or $10 increments, it may take a bit of time before the BTC price comes to my next move.  In that regard, I do not force anything, and I let the price come to my position.. and if I feel I am overleveraged in one direction or another mostly caused by a continuous and unexpected price movement in one direction, I may change those positions a little bit in order to employ either a buy or a sell... and then to thereafter reassess the various staggered bets on each side of the current price. Frequently there can be a run of the BTC price in one direction or another (and if that happens, then I usually choose to adjust the amounts that I am either buying or selling to account for the unexpected continued price movement in that one direction), and  even though I am staggering my bets in $5 or $10 increments from time to time there could also develop more  than a $30 gap in my next buy or sell price.... Which could cause a considerable wait until I exercise my next buy or sell (in bitcoinland, such a wait could last several hours or even several weeks). When the wait is long, I may reassess my position, and decide to trade smaller amounts within the respective broad gap in order to force my trading to become more active again within the ongoing narrow price range. So let me try to illustrate with the example of your holding 20BTC and $2,000 cash... And a BTC price of around $400.  if you were to have 20 BTC and bitcoin prices go up $10, then you have $200 profits on paper, and maybe you could feel comfortable selling up to 30% of those profits ($67) in order to prepare to buy back BTC at a lower price.... and I personally would round down my authorized amount to keep some in reserve and with round numbers  to keep it easier for me to track. So if the price moves upwards and  you sell $60 at $400, you would be authorized to sell another $60 at $410 or alternatively $30 at $405.. and keep staggering your sales with the upward movement of the price.. and if the price seems to be moving upwardly fast, you may choose to wait until $430 before you execute a sale and sell your whole authorized $180 at $430-ish ($60 x 3).  If the price keeps going up, you keep selling within the authorized amounts, and you prepare yourself for buying back when btc prices reverse. If they do not reverse in the short term, you do not panic, you just keep employing your strategy and from time to time reassess your total holdings and there exists any need to tweak your strategy. The same principles apply for buying back as the price goes down.  But sticking with the original hypothetical of a $10 upwards price movement, if I sold $60 at $410, for example, then I may authorize myself to buy back in increments of $5 or $10, so possibly, I would plan to buy $20 at $402, $20 at $397 and $20 at $392.  In this example profits of each trade may not be big, but with the price swings of the market, some orders will begin to cluster and result in higher profits, and also you need to consider that when you do buy low and sell high, the profits are locked in as soon as you buy back and if you want you can continue to trade btc back and forth with the same money within a range that may constitute additional profits if the price does get  stuck within a fairly narrow range that happens to repeatedly hit your buy and sell points. Ultimately, you need to play your allocation of your trades and the amounts by ear and don't over allocate in one direction or another. Accordingly, if you plan and prepare ahead, you will likely continue to accumulate BTC and which will likely cause you to set limits in how much you are authorizing yourself to buy and sell btc  based on your total holdings of BTC and cash in your trading portfolio... Furthermore, regarding the potential for downward price movement, with the above hypothetical, with your $2,000 in your BTC trading reserves, you may want to consider how far you expect BTC prices could drop... Let's say for example, in the current market, you calculate less than a 5% chance that BTC prices will drop below $250 in the next several months. Therefore, you may chose to stagger to use about 80% of your $2,000 to buy at downward increments of about $120 in $10 increments down from $380 to $250.    Then you would still have approximately $400 left in your reserves in what you are calculating to be a fairly unlikely event. On the other hand, if you view probabilities differently (either more bearish or more bullish) then you would allocate in accordance with your view of probabilities while at the same time attempting to be realistic enough in your assessment in order to have reserve resources no matter the price direction and even if what you believe to be unlikely occurs. Of course, you have to tweak these numbers as your portfolio changes in it's reserves of both bitcoins and dollars, and as your expectations may change from time to time, too, but in the end, you want to be prepared for the price to move in either direction, and you prepare for both short and long term. This whole trading strategy  may sound a bit complicated, but it employs basic principles of staggering bets and buying low and selling high.  more or less, I am doing something like my above outlined strategy to trade BTC with up to about 30% of the profits when BTC prices  go up  but I am also preserving my BTC holdings by setting my trade limits within a portion of my profits and accordingly, my comfort level of how much I am willing to sell goes up as the price goes up.. but no matter what the total amount of Bitcoin that I trade continues to stay within 30% of my profit boundaries to preserve a significant level of my principle holdings. With my current trading method, I continue to accumulate more BTC and to bring down my average cost per BTC... while really only selling  (or trading with) a small percentage of my total BTC holdings.  In this regard, it seems that I am selling less than 1% of my BTC holdings within any one trade or cumulatively selling less than 10% over a string of 10 or more trades because usually, the price does NOT move in one direction for more than 10 trades.. .and if it does, then I consider ways to use either the BTC or the dollars in order to reassess my situation and to still be able to invest that money to close some of the earlier taken positions that have been long left behind by BTC's  price movement.",1,24,2016,1_24_2016

If you do not want to trade BTC by pure luck, which is a form of gambling, and you want to have some fairly certain long term profits, then you place your bets in ways that are more secure and the profits are smaller and you work on locking in your profits slowly and in small increments and in this practice there is no free lunch, even though once you take some of your btc trade positions, you may witness very large price movements in one direction or another that you are already in an established position to take advantage of such large price movements and accordingly to take larger than expected profits because of that large price movement.  Ultimately, the idea is to attempt to trade btc securely and with profits and continuously build staggered trade positions on both the buying and selling sides and to have those positions be small and profitable all the way up and down the line.  In this regard, you do not attempt to predict the price and you buy BTC on the way down and sell on the way up.This BTC trading strategy will work with any amount of total BTC holdings, and the more capital that you have to employ towards the systematic approach, then the greater the potential profits, but even if you start out with smaller amounts than those amounts described herein, the number of BTC and dollars in your trading portfolio can be built and expanded over time and sticking with the same trading strategy described herein will likely build and expand the number of your coins ... as you are learning from your BTC trading practices and watching the BTC trading market.Let's say hypothetically that over the years, you have accumulated 20 bitcoins into your trading portfolio (currently that is worth about $8,000), and maybe you have about $2,000 in cash... So for round numbers and argument sake you have a total value of $10,000 in your btc trading portfolio (yes the same principles would apply whether you have a total portfolio of $100 or a total of $1 million as well). Accordingly,  .... With your current position and allocation of 20 btc which quantities will change with your taking new positions, each time BTC prices go up by $1, you have approximately $20 of profit on paper. More or less, with a BTC  price of around $400, I personally set my trade authorizations in either $5 or $10 price increments depending on my anticipation of the speed of the BTC price movements and whether I believe that the price is going to change from going in one direction towards the opposite direction.  Even though I hold varying expectations that the short term BTC price will move in one direction or another, I don't attempt to predict with any certainty regarding those short term btc price directions, and I just hope that over the long term BTC  prices will be going up and my trading strategies are thus designed to continue to accumulate more BTC and don't necessarily require the adding of additional dollars towards building more bitcoins. Even though I may trade in $5 or $10 increments, it may take a bit of time before the BTC price comes to my next move.  In that regard, I do not force anything, and I let the price come to my position.. and if I feel I am overleveraged in one direction or another mostly caused by a continuous and unexpected price movement in one direction, I may change those positions a little bit in order to employ either a buy or a sell... and then to thereafter reassess the various staggered bets on each side of the current price. Frequently there can be a run of the BTC price in one direction or another (and if that happens, then I usually choose to adjust the amounts that I am either buying or selling to account for the unexpected continued price movement in that one direction), and  even though I am staggering my bets in $5 or $10 increments from time to time there could also develop more  than a $30 gap in my next buy or sell price.... Which could cause a considerable wait until I exercise my next buy or sell (in bitcoinland, such a wait could last several hours or even several weeks). When the wait is long, I may reassess my position, and decide to trade smaller amounts within the respective broad gap in order to force my trading to become more active again within the ongoing narrow price range. So let me try to illustrate with the example of your holding 20BTC and $2,000 cash... And a BTC price of around $400.  if you were to have 20 BTC and bitcoin prices go up $10, then you have $200 profits on paper, and maybe you could feel comfortable selling up to 30% of those profits ($67) in order to prepare to buy back BTC at a lower price.... and I personally would round down my authorized amount to keep some in reserve and with round numbers  to keep it easier for me to track. So if the price moves upwards and  you sell $60 at $400, you would be authorized to sell another $60 at $410 or alternatively $30 at $405.. and keep staggering your sales with the upward movement of the price.. and if the price seems to be moving upwardly fast, you may choose to wait until $430 before you execute a sale and sell your whole authorized $180 at $430-ish ($60 x 3).  If the price keeps going up, you keep selling within the authorized amounts, and you prepare yourself for buying back when btc prices reverse. If they do not reverse in the short term, you do not panic, you just keep employing your strategy and from time to time reassess your total holdings and there exists any need to tweak your strategy. The same principles apply for buying back as the price goes down.  But sticking with the original hypothetical of a $10 upwards price movement, if I sold $60 at $410, for example, then I may authorize myself to buy back in increments of $5 or $10, so possibly, I would plan to buy $20 at $402, $20 at $397 and $20 at $392.  In this example profits of each trade may not be big, but with the price swings of the market, some orders will begin to cluster and result in higher profits, and also you need to consider that when you do buy low and sell high, the profits are locked in as soon as you buy back and if you want you can continue to trade btc back and forth with the same money within a range that may constitute additional profits if the price does get  stuck within a fairly narrow range that happens to repeatedly hit your buy and sell points. Ultimately, you need to play your allocation of your trades and the amounts by ear and don't over allocate in one direction or another. Accordingly, if you plan and prepare ahead, you will likely continue to accumulate BTC and which will likely cause you to set limits in how much you are authorizing yourself to buy and sell btc  based on your total holdings of BTC and cash in your trading portfolio... Furthermore, regarding the potential for downward price movement, with the above hypothetical, with your $2,000 in your BTC trading reserves, you may want to consider how far you expect BTC prices could drop... Let's say for example, in the current market, you calculate less than a 5% chance that BTC prices will drop below $250 in the next several months. Therefore, you may chose to stagger to use about 80% of your $2,000 to buy at downward increments of about $120 in $10 increments down from $380 to $250.    Then you would still have approximately $400 left in your reserves in what you are calculating to be a fairly unlikely event. On the other hand, if you view probabilities differently (either more bearish or more bullish) then you would allocate in accordance with your view of probabilities while at the same time attempting to be realistic enough in your assessment in order to have reserve resources no matter the price direction and even if what you believe to be unlikely occurs. Of course, you have to tweak these numbers as your portfolio changes in it's reserves of both bitcoins and dollars, and as your expectations may change from time to time, too, but in the end, you want to be prepared for the price to move in either direction, and you prepare for both short and long term. This whole trading strategy  may sound a bit complicated, but it employs basic principles of staggering bets and buying low and selling high.  more or less, I am doing something like my above outlined strategy to trade BTC with up to about 30% of the profits when BTC prices  go up  but I am also preserving my BTC holdings by setting my trade limits within a portion of my profits and accordingly, my comfort level of how much I am willing to sell goes up as the price goes up.. but no matter what the total amount of Bitcoin that I trade continues to stay within 30% of my profit boundaries to preserve a significant level of my principle holdings. With my current trading method, I continue to accumulate more BTC and to bring down my average cost per BTC... while really only selling  (or trading with) a small percentage of my total BTC holdings.  In this regard, it seems that I am selling less than 1% of my BTC holdings within any one trade or cumulatively selling less than 10% over a string of 10 or more trades because usually, the price does NOT move in one direction for more than 10 trades.. .and if it does, then I consider ways to use either the BTC or the dollars in order to reassess my situation and to still be able to invest that money to close some of the earlier taken positions that have been long left behind by BTC's  price movement.",1,24,2016,1_24_2016

However, I am providing a lot more suggestions regarding actual implementation strategies. You asserted that people won't share their btc trading  strategies, but are you looking for more secrets than I provided?  I'm not holding back, and this works very well. Do you expect a quicker and better way to get rich from trading?  Surely, people will have some secret tricks (including yours truly) , but the little tricks can be discovered on your own, but you gotta really employ some foundational variation of the basics first, and that's the bread and butter of the profits and allowing any secret additional tricks to work, if they exist. If you employ some detailed variation of what I'm suggesting above then you will likely be in a better position to get lucky from time to time too, rather than simply employing some vague and non-specific  notion of ""buying low, selling high.""  The devil is in the details, as they say. ",1,24,2016,1_24_2016

Because, along with growing bitcoin ambitions, we must concentrate of securing our bitcoins. Avoiding HYIP and gambling are definitely will save your bitcoins but only signature campaign is not enough to grow your bitcoins.With a signature campaign in my opinion is enough to regenerate bitcoin but not fast and takes a long process. If you want to increase and accelerate growth is to create two signature campaign or also by selling services such as creating a logo, it would increase the income bitcoin to be growing.working in more than signature campaign consume a lot of time and effort, unless you spam threads, so you risk being kicked out from the campaign and even blocked from this forum, so it's not as easy as you imagineYep, a lot of work for maybe $10 or $15 a week... but once you are in one, and if you are just posting regularly (as you would anyhow), you don't really have to do any additional work, so the whole participation becomes a form of additional fairly passive income to add to obtaining ""free"" bitcoins....

I mean you can't blindly throw coins in both directions since that for sure will make you lose because of the trading fees.Yes.  You are correct that if a person does not buy low and sell high, then that person will not be profitable... so any trading plan has to at least meet those minimum parameters.To attempt to further respond to your question regarding setting up orders on both sides, my post provides considerable detailed suggestions providing examples about how to accomplish staggering orders, and you are also correct to the extent that you cannot know for sure which way the price will be moving in the short term.  My plan does not rely on knowing the direction of price movement, even though I will get inclinations to tweak a little bit in one direction or another to bet more or less and/or to preserve funds for continued and unexpected overshooting (which bitcoin seems inclined to do).   Therefore, I will be continuously staggering and readjusting my bets on each side in order to continue to buy on the way down and to continue to sell on the way up.  I use the word ""bet"" for ease of reference, but I am really not betting..   For the most part, I execute my trade when the price meets my marker...and sometimes I adjust the marker on the fly, because I don't really want to buy if I think the price is going lower in the near term and I really don't want to sell if I think the price is going higher in the near term.. but if it is not clear about price movement, then I will just execute the buy or the sell in order to lock in the amount.Ultimately, the trader has to more or less keep track of how much he is buying and/or selling because he cannot get tricked into buying higher than he is selling or selling lower than he is buying.. and these numbers are continuously moving when a position is opened or closed.I believe that my previous post provides sufficient details of examples, and it will make a lot more sense after aspiring traders attempt to put the outlined recommendations into practice and then maybe read again after practicing... and even develop his/her own custom-tailored approach to how much to trade and at what triggering points.I actually do not bet in ways to short BTC or bet more BTC than i have in what is called margin trading  (or leveraged trading) because in essence, I am not attempting to predict the direction of the BTC prices with any precision and I think that a person can make sufficient quantities by merely employing basic principles that I outlined.  There are plenty of opportunities to increase BTC stash and dollars by just having btc and dollars available and to stagger the orders in order to be able to continue to buy as  the price is going down and continue to sell as the price is going up.Even though in my earlier post, I provided smaller numbers of a person who has 20 BTC and $2,000 (a $10K budget in total), which would require smaller buys and sells than my own, my current actual buy and sell staggering looks like this:My current tentative buy plan is:$336.00           0.74404762   $250.00$345.00           0.57971014   $200.00$354.00           0.56497175   $200.00$361.00      0.55401662   $200.00$368.00      0.54347826   $200.00$373.00      0.53619303   $200.00$378.00      0.52910053   $200.00$384.00      0.52083333   $200.00$392.00      0.38265306   $150.00My current tentative sell plan is:$403.00      $150.00           0.372208437$408.00      $250.00           0.612745098$414.00      $250.00       0.603864734$419.00      $250.00       0.596658711$423.00      $400.00       0.945626478$428.00      $400.00           0.934579439$433.00      $400.00           0.923787529$438.00      $400.00       0.913242009$443.00      $400.00           0.902934537$448.00      $500.00       1.116071429 My buy/sell plan is not strict or concrete, and also sometimes there may be some quirks in the numbers based on some of my previous actions regarding positions that I consider to have still open (more or less in my records).  Anyhow, if BTC prices rush beyond my buy / sell points then I may wait and/or combine buying or selling authorized quantities, and after I execute any buy/sell transaction, then I will adjust my projected target numbers on the opposite end.  So for example, in the current above described scenario, if BTC prices go passed $403, then I will sell $150 and then adjust my buy numbers accordingly, and maybe I would then add a plan to buy $150 at $397 or make some other tweaks to my quantities and trigger points (like for example buying $75 at $397 and $200 at $392 and $225 at $384).  There are a variety of ways to tweak and to stay realistic about how much to allocate and at what price points.  On the other hand, in the current above set of price plans if the price goes down to below $392, then I will buy $150, and then I may plan to sell $150 at $399 or some other tweaks in my plan within my judgement.  If the price is rushing in one direction or another, I may let the price go passed the pre-planned buy/sell amount and then combine at some point in the middle to make either my buy or my sell in order to lock in and to profit off of the rush of the price change.   As anyone should realize there is a considerable increased ability to make a lot more money (either BTC or dollars) when the price changes a lot in a short period of time, but it only works if you have orders staggered in each direction and then you wait out the quick change to combine your buys or sells in order to increase the locked in amount.  In this regard, it is sometimes better to lock in the amount early rather than getting greedy because a person is frequently going to have trouble timing the exact top or bottom, and we do not want to get too greedy because it could result in further losses or too much stress regarding the whole practice of attempting to lock in profits at various points and then to thereafter readjust the various positions based on the favorable trade.  If the price continues to unexpectedly move in the same direction, then one still needs to have funds available for that continued movement to be able to continue to profit from that direction or to profit in the even that the price changes directions (whether slowly or quickly).  Ultimately, though I am providing some trading guidelines to stagger trades, my plan is not strict, but I am always balancing to make sure that I keep funds on each side of the price movement to be buying with dollars when the price goes down and selling with bitcoins when the price goes up... but I am calculating all of my trades in dollars for simplicity sake and also to make it easier for me to keep track of my amounts of trades ... and to be able to bank my profits in bitcoins, which amounts to an ongoing and continued accumulation of bitcoins.I hope this further explanation helps.By the way, even though I am describing a lot of dynamics, sometimes, trades may occur frequently during a day, but sometimes, it may take several days before any trades are executed.  Furthermore, a person should also have the ability to set target trade amounts at further out intervals, if s/he wants to be relieved of trading for a while... and accordingly trade on bigger price swings.",1,25,2016,1_25_2016

Another tool within this strategy is the employment of dollar cost averaging in order that you do not necessarily have to predict the short term price direction of various assets (even while you are attempting to invest in assets that you believe will appreciate over time).",1,26,2016,1_26_2016

I've been doing this for a few months already, and spent about 7 hours/day on that. In general, you can earn about 35.000-70.000 satoshi per hour (rewards vary from faucet to faucet). 2) On that very day, put all what you have earned in cloud mining. At first, the rewards will be miserable and will look not even worth it. Some time after, you will already be able to re-buy on that very day when you receive rewards from the cloud. 3) Do not forget to collect form the faucet as well. Some time after, you'll see more acceptable sums (about a month and a half would have passed already).4) Repeat it constantly.5) 6) PROFIT!!!Are you REALLY sure that you earned more from mining than you paid to invest there? There practically only exists cloud miners who are either complete scam or where you invest but over all the runtime would will not even get your investment back from the earnings.",1,27,2016,1_27_2016

I've been doing this for a few months already, and spent about 7 hours/day on that. In general, you can earn about 35.000-70.000 satoshi per hour (rewards vary from faucet to faucet). 2) On that very day, put all what you have earned in cloud mining. At first, the rewards will be miserable and will look not even worth it. Some time after, you will already be able to re-buy on that very day when you receive rewards from the cloud. 3) Do not forget to collect form the faucet as well. Some time after, you'll see more acceptable sums (about a month and a half would have passed already).4) Repeat it constantly.5) 6) PROFIT!!!Are you REALLY sure that you earned more from mining than you paid to invest there? There practically only exists cloud miners who are either complete scam or where you invest but over all the runtime would will not even get your investment back from the earnings.That's the point - when the difficulty rises, maintenance fees will become bigger and bigger related to the revenue, while your hashrate will become less and less effective. I was also experimenting with cloud mining, but after first difficulty change everything became clear. Hopefully i didn't invest any significant amount and was able to withdraw.",1,27,2016,1_27_2016

Most of them are filled with clickbait malware advertisements and fake cloud mining websites that lure poor visitors who aren't aware of their evil and ponzi schemes. Also to be able to mine by yourself, you'll need lots of investment in ASIC miners and many of them with low electricity costs, the risk involved in this kind of investment is huge considering the growing costs of electricity if you're not in a country with cheap electricity.",1,28,2016,1_28_2016

Probably better if it follows a signature campaign before and after the familiar I'm sure if trying to trade will be successful, as it also would get capital to trade.Trading is too soon for a newbie and you are right about it, you will need knowledge when it comes to trading and you can get it in this forum by reading all information you need to know with bitcoin, I think bitcoin discussion will be great to start getting knowledge!

How you do that? Buy an altcoin and wait that its worth grows? That sounds very much like gamblin. Or do you have a strategy in which to invest?Altcoin trading needs deeper research than doing an exchange trading from BTC -> USD or USD -> BTC.In altcoin trading, some of the factors that you need to know is the status of the coin you would like to invest. Checking it's developrs, main thread here, volume etc. More tips can be given by the community in Altcoin Discussion Section if you are really interested.That is certainly true. When you consider into investing in an alt coin, don't just spend money on it because it has better features or technology, but instead look for those who have a solid market cap, a great community and development. Those that are worth the try, might be alt coins whose supply is very limited like Diamond (DMD) and Crypto Bullion (CBX) They will usually rise in price due to the fact that they are very rare, and thus it could be the possibility of having more demand for limited supply. It might not always work, but it is a method to grow your BTC. Just my opinion. ",1,29,2016,1_29_2016

I have developed a new Bitcoin only web advertising network that lets you invest your wasted web traffic in a long-term strategy and turn your web traffic into web advertising opportunity and into Bitcoin.The current web advertising field (dominated by Google Adsense/Adwords) uses a business model called ""ad networks"" in which all of the top one hundred ad networks combined (including Google) have only penetrated 20% of the available web sites. That means there are still an incredible 80% of web sites that do not use Ad Networks to turn their web traffic into money (that's why I say it is wasted).Even if you DON'T want to earn Bitcoin, still visit Bungeebones.com and add your website link/url (for free) and start advertising in this distributed ad network. Your ad will be distributed through the network (kind of like broadcasting  a transaction in the blockchain) and every site will display it.
