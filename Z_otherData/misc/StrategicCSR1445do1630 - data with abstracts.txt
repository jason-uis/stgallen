TI The Impact of External Monitoring and Public Reporting on Business
   Performance in a Global Manufacturing Industry
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB This study examines the importance of external monitoring and public reporting on the performance of firms in the global apparel industry. By focusing on the relevance of company reputation in the global community, the authors examine financial performance and stock market reaction to the release of information describing the manufacturing practices of firms made available by a third-party monitor. Using agency theory as a predictive framework, industry-wide changes in market measures of company risk as a result of third-party monitoring are found, suggesting that society values such external reports. The authors' findings are important to business and society because they bridge the gap in knowledge about how voluntary compliance programs are supplemented by external monitoring and reporting for firms operating in the global environment. This work suggests that external monitoring is valuable to business and society by reducing information asymmetry between the two groups and encouraging accurate assessment of the risks associated with global operations.

TI Do Credible Firms Perform Better in Emerging Markets? Evidence from
   China
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Prior research suggests that corporate credibility is associated with firm financial performance in developed countries. This article examines whether corporate credibility is related to firm performance using Economic Observer's rating of corporate credibility in China, the largest emerging market in the world. Based on a four-stage valuation model, we find that more reputable and credible firms outperform those with low ratings by almost 20% in 3-year stock returns and have better 3-year net profit margins, return on equity, and sales growth. This study is the first to directly examine the relationship between corporate credibility and firm performance in emerging markets such as China, and our results confirm that firms with high credibility exhibit better financial and market performance at least in the following 3 years.

TI Inverting the Pyramid of Values? Trends in Less-Developed Countries
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The authors discuss the consistency of transnational companies in their home, as well as in less developed host countries, concerning ethics, values and social responsibility. Ethical behavior offers good reputation, credibility and tradition to the corporation. It leads to corporate social, environmental and economic responsibilities, cooperating to the desired sustainability. This paper analyzes the inversion of values that corporate governance systems have suffered. The meaning and implication of the corporate social responsibility is investigated and discussed. A "pyramid of values" is built upon individual ethical values at the basis. Over them, the organizational ethical values should indicate the limits of operations, so that the corporate social responsibility can be sustained, in the top. The authors comment that ethical values no longer lead the organization. Its communication with the stakeholders, specifically through reports, has been gradually replacing the code of ethics and corporate values. These reports have taken the basis of the pyramid leading the organizations to socially irresponsible and unethical behavior. They do not guarantee transparency or communicate the needs of the society. It appears that transnational companies do not behave the same way in their home country as they do in host countries, particularly in less developed regions like Latin America and Africa. Lack of communication and transparency may induce employees to unethical decisions and transform the reporting system into a marketing instrument. In order to guarantee compliance with the codes, transparency and ethical responsibility, communication within the organization is essential.

TI Occupational health and safety in the framework of corporate social
   responsibility
SO SAFETY SCIENCE
AB Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been defined as the voluntary integration of social and environmental concerns into the firm's decision-making. The search for a good Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) environment and the promotion of a culture of risk prevention are two of the firm's main social responsibilities, and consequently an integral part of CSR. This paper discusses how the growing interest in corporate social responsibility can contribute to improving the implementation of adequate systems of prevention. For this purpose, we study to what extent OHS issues are present in the field of CSR, and consequently determine which aspects have received the most attention, and which are less well developed; we offer some proposals as well. The methodology followed is a content analysis of the main international CSR management tools. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasingly recognized need for new products for so-called neglected diseases, which afflict large numbers of people but have received relatively little industry investment, presents a clear example of a "strategic" corporate responsibility. Addressing neglected diseases can be important to "health diplomacy" and other national interests as well. Because industrial capabilities are essential to the development of new drugs and vaccines for these diseases, specific policy initiatives to attract more companies to do such work should also be further developed.

TI The Contribution of Environmental and Social Standards Towards Ensuring
   Legitimacy in Supply Chain Governance
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Increasingly, companies implement social and environmental standards as instruments towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chains. This is based on the assumption that such standards increase legitimacy among stakeholders. Yet, a wide variety of standards with different requirement levels exist and companies might tend to introduce the ones with low exigencies, using them as a legitimacy front. This strategy jeopardizes the reputation of social and environmental standards among stakeholders and their long-term trust in these instruments of CSR, meaning that all expenses for their implementation are of no avail for the companies. Therefore, this paper highlights which criteria are important for the selection, implementation and improvement in order to achieve a company's aim, but also to strengthen the legitimacy of social and environmental standards. This research is based on conceptual thought and some existing empirical research, comparing four different social and environmental standards, revealing weaknesses and strengths. It exposes the basic conditions for the success of such standards among stakeholders and identifies the need for more empirical data.

TI Corporate Hypocrisy: Overcoming the Threat of Inconsistent Corporate
   Social Responsibility Perceptions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Reports of firms' behaviors with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) are often contrary to their stated standards of social responsibility. This research examines the effects of communication strategies a firm can use to mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on consumer perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and subsequent beliefs about the firm's social responsibility and attitudes toward the firm. Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing. Study 2 finds that varying CSR policy statement abstractness acts to reduce the hidden risk of proactive communication strategies and can improve the effectiveness of a reactive strategy. Study 3 reveals that an inoculation communication strategy reduces perceived hypocrisy and minimizes its negative consequences, regardless of whether the CSR strategy is proactive or reactive.

TI The Debate over Doing Good: Corporate Social Performance, Strategic
   Marketing Levers, and Firm-Idiosyncratic Risk
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Marketers and investors face a heated, provocative debate over whether excelling in social responsibility initiatives hurts or benefits firms financially. This study develops a theoretical framework that predicts (1) the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on firm-idiosyncratic risk and (2) the role of two strategic marketing levers, advertising and research and development (R&D), in explaining the variability of this impact among different firms. The results show that higher CSP lowers undesirable firm-idiosyncratic risk. Notably, although the salutary impact of CSP is greater in firms with higher (versus lower) advertising, a simultaneous pursuit for CSP, advertising, and R&D is harmful with increased firm-idiosyncratic risk. For theory, the authors advance the literature on the marketing-finance interface by drawing attention to the risk-reduction potential of CSP and by shedding new light on some critical but neglected roles of strategic marketing levers. They also extend CSP research by moving away from the long-fought battle for a universal CSP impact and toward a finer-grained understanding of when some firms derive more risk-reduction benefits from CSP. For practice, the results indicate that the "goodwill refund" of CSP is not unconditional. They also empower marketers to communicate more effectively with investors (i.e., doing good to better manage the risk surrounding firm stock prices).

TI Does a Firm's Product-Recall Strategy Affect Its Financial Value? An
   Examination of Strategic Alternatives During Product-Harm Crises
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Product-harm crises often result in product recalls, which can have a significant impact on a firm's reputation, sales, and financial value. In managing the recall process, some firms adopt a proactive strategy in responding to consumer complaints, while others are more passive. In this study, the authors examine the impact of these strategic alternatives on firm value using Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls during a 12-year period from 1996 to 2007. Using the event study method, the authors show that regardless of firm and product characteristics, proactive strategies have a more negative effect on firm value than more passive strategies. An explanation for this surprising result is that the stock market interprets proactive strategies as a signal of substantial financial losses to the firm. When a firm proactively manages a product recall, the stock market infers that the consequence of the product-harm crisis is sufficiently severe that the firm had no choice but to act swiftly to reduce potential financial losses. Therefore, firms dealing with product recalls must be sensitive to how investors might interpret a proactive strategy and be aware of its potential drawbacks.

TI Do Fans Care? Assessing the Influence of Corporate Social Responsibility
   on Consumer Attitudes in the Sport Industry
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB Organizations within the sport industry are facing increasing pressure to both maintain profitability and behave in socially acceptable ways, yet researchers have provided little information on how consumers perceive and react to corporate social responsibility (CSR). This mixed-design study examined the relationship between CSR activities and fans' assessments of reputation and patronage intentions. In addition, the study sought to determine the role of team identification in the aforementioned relationship. Fans of two NFL teams were sampled (N = 297), with quantitative results suggesting that CSR is an important predictor of reputation, and that two types of patronage could be significantly impacted as well. The moderating effect of team identification was significant yet influenced the outcomes in different ways. Qualitative findings reinforced the quantitative discussion by providing support for the general conclusions that CSR was viewed favorably by most fans, and is an important aspect of the overall business strategy of a sport organization.

TI Managing reputational risk in an economic downturn: The case of Banco
   Santander
SO PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
AB One of the fields most affected by the crisis is the financial sector. Nevertheless, Spain's banks have so far held Lip relatively well, and this article's examination of one of the leaders, Banco Santander, shows. The authors argue that the Bank's current strong position is not just attributable to Spanish regulations for conservative lending practices, or to the fact that Spanish banks did not invest in U.S. subprime mortgage products, but also to their well-established Reputational Risk Management programs. The article illustrates Banco Santander's management of reputation and proposes the bank as a paradigmatic case for the importance of dialogue and reputation in these times of turbulence. Because of this focus, the approach is largely uncritical, rather than balanced, ill concentrating oil how Banco Santander offers evidence of a paradigm shift in action that offers a model For effectively addressing the economic downturn. The article concludes by suggesting the key role for public relations in managing reputational risk under contemporary conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI RESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POLITICS: CORPORATE DISCLOSURE OF
   CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES
SO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB The challenges associated with climate change will require governments, citizens, and firms to work collaboratively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a task that requires information on companies' carbon risks, opportunities, strategies, and emission levels. This paper explores the conditions under which firms participate in this endeavor. Building on theories of how social activists inspire changes in organizational norms, beliefs, and practices, we hypothesize that shareholder actions and regulatory threats are likely to prime firms to adopt practices consistent with the aims of a broader social movement. We find empirical evidence of direct and spillover effects. In the domain of private politics, shareholder resolutions filed against a firm and others in its industry increase a firm's propensity to engage in practices consistent with the aims of the related social movement. Similarly, in the realm of public politics, threats of state regulations targeted at a firm's industry as well as regulations targeted at other industries increase the likelihood that the firm will engage in such practices. These findings extend existing theory by showing that both activist groups and government actors can spur changes in organizational practices, and that challenges mounted against a single firm or a single industry can inspire both firm and field-level changes.

TI An Investigation of Real Versus Perceived CSP in S&P-500 Firms
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Firms are spending billions annually in the name of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Whilst markets are increasingly willing to reward good and responsible firms, they lack the instruments to measure corporate social performance (CSP). To convince investors and other stakeholders, firms invest heavily in building a reputation for good corporate behaviour. This article argues that reputations for CSP are often unrepresentative of true CSP and investigates how differences in aEuro(1)perceived' and aEuro(1)actual' - as measured by the Fortune and KLD databases, respectively - can partly be explained by firm characteristics. Amongst other things, it finds that overrated firms are more likely to be relatively big, profitable, operating in non-polluting but competitive industries and with no history of wrong doings to their primary stakeholders. They will also typically spend a lot of effort satisfying the claims of their secondary stakeholders. Above all, the results emphasise the need for researchers to recognise that the databases measure different phenomenon and are not interchangeable.

AB Although a number of studies have shown that corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities often lead to greater organisational performance in western developed economies, researchers are yet to examine the strategic value of CSR in emerging economies. Using survey data from 280 firms operating in Dubai, this study examines the link between CSR activities and organisational performance. The results show that CSR has a positive relationship with all three measures of organisational performance: financial performance, employee commitment, and corporate reputation. These results reinforce the accumulating body of empirical support for the positive impact of CSR on performance and challenge the dominant assumption that, given the weak institutional framework in emerging economies, CSR activities drain resources and compromise firms' competitiveness.

TI The origin of corporate social responsibility: global forces or national
   legacies?
SO SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This paper explores the relative importance of global forces and national political-economic institutions for companies' willingness and ability to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR). The globalist hypothesis postulates that a company's CSR efforts are a function of the dictates of the global market place: strong anti-globalization and anti-corporate sentiments generate a need for a positive reputation to obtain a 'social license to operate'. The institutionalist hypothesis postulates that a company's CSR efforts are a function of institutional factors in the national political-economic system: companies based in political-economic systems with strong institutions for social embedding of the economy have comparative institutional advantages for success in CSR. The hypotheses are examined quantitatively by testing an index of national CSR performance against well-established political-economic indicators. The final analysis, based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), reveals causal heterogeneity and indicates two separate pathways leading to CSR success.

TI Corporate Responsiveness to Community Stakeholders Effects of Contextual
   and Organizational Characteristics
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB Corporate community responsiveness relates to business activities that are integral parts of a firm's operations and are designed to benefit the firm through benefiting the local communities. Using data from commercial banks in the United States between 1997 and 2000, the authors measured banks' corporate community responsiveness by their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) lending activities and their performance ratings by CRA examiners. The authors developed and tested eight hypotheses on the influence of contextual (community income, minority population, and competition) and organizational (age, profitability, risk, institutional ownership, and mergers and acquisitions) factors on the two measures of corporate community responsiveness. The authors found a negative effect for minority population; a positive effect for banks' profitability; and partial support for community income, competition, and risk factors. The results show no effects for institutional ownership or mergers and acquisitions. The implications of these results for the instrumental aspect of stakeholder theory are discussed.

TI The Nature of Giving A Theory of Planned Behavior Examination of
   Corporate Philanthropy
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB Scholars of social issues in management have consistently argued that corporate philanthropy is one key factor of a firm's discretionary responsibilities. Several researchers have examined the links between philanthropy and such outcomes as financial profit and organizational reputation. It is interesting to note that the determinants of corporate philanthropy have been left largely unexamined; researchers have yet to fully understand why philanthropy takes place. In this manuscript, Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB) provides the theoretical foundation for the development of a model that will further our understanding of corporate philanthropic behaviors. The TPB has been used and validated in many different academic fields (such as psychology, exercise science, and management information systems) as a means to understand the determinants of behavior. The authors build on the TPB and examine empirically how altruistic and strategic forces, perceived behavioral control, self-identity, and slack influence philanthropic behaviors.

TI Effects of Pro-Environmental Recruiting Messages: The Role of
   Organizational Reputation
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY
AB The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a pro-environmental corporate message on prospective applicants' attitudes toward a fictitious hiring organization. Drawing from signaling theory, we hypothesized that an environmental message on the organization's recruitment website would increase prospective applicants' perceptions of organizational prestige, which would then increase job pursuit intentions. Personal environmental attitudes were also examined as a possible moderator.
   Participants (N = 183) viewed a web site printout that either did or did not contain a message indicating the organization's environmental support. Participants rated their attitudes toward the environment, perceptions of the organization, and job pursuit intentions.
   Findings demonstrated that the environmental support message positively affected job pursuit intentions; further, this effect was mediated by perceptions of the organization's reputation. Contrary to the person-organization fit perspective, the message's effects on job pursuit intentions were not contingent upon the participant's own environmental stance.
   These findings highlight the importance of corporate social performance as a source of information for a variety of job seekers. Even relatively small amounts of information regarding corporate social performance can positively affect an organization's reputation and recruitment efforts.
   In general, this research contributes to the growing body of literature on corporate social responsibility. It is the first study to test whether the effects of pro-environmental recruiting messages on job pursuit intentions depend upon an applicant's personal environmental stance. In addition, this is the first study to demonstrate reputation's meditational role in the effects of corporate social responsibility on recruitment efforts.

It will further endeavour to evaluate the impact of such communications on an organisation's corporate reputation and brand image. The proliferation of unsubstantiated ethical claims and so-called 'green washing' by some companies has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust. This has made the task of communicating with, and more importantly convincing, an organisation's stakeholders vis-A -vis its CSR credentials even more difficult. This paper argues that marketing communications tools can play a major role in conveying a company's CSR messages and communicating a more socially responsible image.

TI STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS AND THE PERSISTENCE OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL
   PERFORMANCE
SO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB We examine the effect of a firm's relations with its nonfinancial stakeholders, including its employees, suppliers, customers, and communities, on the persistence of both superior and inferior financial performance. In particular, integrating and extending the resource-based view of the firm and stakeholder management literatures, we develop the arguments that good stakeholder relations not only enable a firm with superior financial performance to sustain its competitive advantage for a longer period of tune, but more importantly, also help poorly performing firms to recover from disadvantageous positions more quickly. The arguments are supported by the analysis of a series of first-order autoregressive models. Our findings further suggest that the positive effect of good stakeholder relations oil the persistence of superior performance is not as strong as that of some other firm resources, such as technological knowledge, but it is the only,factor examined that promises to help a firm recover from inferior performance. Therefore, the role of positive stakeholder relations in helping poorly performing firms recover is found to be more critical than its role in helping superior firms sustain their performance advantage.

TI Revisiting the Vexing Question: Does Superior Corporate Social
   Performance Lead to Improved Financial Performance?
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB The empirical evidence documenting the association between a firm's level of corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) remains divided. This paper reinvestigates the CSP/CFP association using a more rigorous methodology whilst taking advantage of a superior measure of CSP. In contrast to the findings of much of the prior research, the market-based tests suggest a negative association between CSP and CFP, while the accounting tests indicate no association exists. We suggest that the negative market CSP/CFP relation should not be interpreted as CSP having no value. Rather, our results may suggest that leading CSP firms trade at a price premium (i.e. returns discount) relative to lagging CSP firms, thereby indicating that financial markets value CSP and are prepared to realise lower returns. For firms, this signals an ability to obtain a lower cost of equity capital when they proactively manage their CSP profiles.

TI Economic and Social Roles of Companies in the Mass Media The Impact
   Media Visibility Has on Businesses' Being Recognized as Economic and
   Social Actors
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB Businesses play an important social role in society that goes beyond their traditional economic role. The way in which these roles are carried out and communicated to the stakeholders can influence the company's corporate reputation. The first step in constructing a corporate reputation is corporate visibility. The mass media plays an important role in developing corporate visibility. Media visibility has a significant influence on public opinion and contributes strongly to forming companies' corporate reputation. The main aim of this article is to test the level of visibility of companies in the media as well as the attributes (economic and/or social) assigned to the companies. The author presents the results of the research done on the media visibility of companies belonging to the Spanish Stock Exchange in the four most important newspapers in Spain. Two basic results were obtained: Larger companies, with good reputations and oriented to mass consumption, have more visibility in newspapers, and companies are basically presented as economic and not social actors in society.

TI Corporate Charitable Giving, Multinational Companies and Countries of
   Concern
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB This paper investigates the degree to which corporate charitable giving is influenced by a firm's internationalization and/or whether it has operations in one or more countries of concern. For a sample of large UK firms, we find evidence of a positive effect not for internationalization per se, but only for a presence in particular countries. In this connection, the salient country characteristic is a lack of political rights and/or civil liberties, and the positive impact on charitable giving is restricted to a presence in only those countries that are, according to Freedom House indicators, most lacking in this respect. Furthermore, our study highlights a mode of corporate response to stakeholder concerns and pressures - offsetting - that is qualitatively different from those suggested in earlier conceptual literatures.

AB This article explores the conceptual and practical gap existing between the developed and developing countries in relation to corporate social responsibility (CSR), or the North-South 'CSR Divide', through the analysis of possible impact on the competitiveness of developing countries' and economies' SMEs and MNEs in globalization. To do so, this article first reviewed the traditional wisdom on the concept of strategic CSR developed in the North and the role that CSR engagement can play in corporate competitiveness, and compare with the impact on the competitive advantage of the South through the supply chains. It points out that among the many factors that could explain the 'CSR Divide', the negative impact of CSR on comparative advantage is the final resort where developing countries are reluctant and defensive toward western-style CSR. It did point out that developing countries are changing their approaches to make CSR work in favor of their competitive position in global trade, such as China who has started to adopt proactive approach by becoming CSR standards-setter. This article concludes with two policy proposals that aim to bridge the CSR gap, the first is to improve CSR standard-setting participation from both sides, and the second to search for solutions in the international investment legal framework which will define corporate obligations in relating to CSR in a more explicit way.

TI Exploring the Nature of the Relationship Between CSR and Competitiveness
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper explores the nature of the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and competitiveness. We start with the commonly held view that firm competitiveness is defined by the market. That is, the question of what are the critical competitiveness factors is answered by looking at how companies and financial analysts describe and evaluate a firm. To analyze this, we review the current state of the art on the relationship between CSR and competitiveness. Second, CSR criteria used by financial analysts is identified and compared with company valuation methods. Third, the results of a multi-stakeholder dialogue on CSR and competitiveness of the European financial sector are presented. As a conclusion, we argue that CSR and competitiveness relate through a learning and innovation cycle, where corporate values, policies and practices are permanently defined and re-defined. Thus, we propose that learning takes place as CSR is embedded in business processes, and that once it has been integrated, in turn, it generates innovative practices, and finally, competitiveness. At the end of the paper, we propose that CSR in practice consists of managing inherent paradoxes generated by the tension between CSR and business policies.

Three key questions were addressed. First, what do managers in this sample see as the primary reasons their companies engage in activities that benefit society? Second, do motives for such social initiative vary across the industries represented? Third, can further empirical support be provided for the theoretical classifications of social initiative motives outlined in the literature? Previous research on the topic is reviewed, study methods are described, results are presented, and implications of findings are discussed.

TI Corporate Sustainability Reporting: A Study in Disingenuity?
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Over recent years, there has been a focus in corporate activity upon the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and one of its central platforms, the notion of sustainability, and particularly sustainable development. We argue in this article that the use of such a term has the effect of obfuscating the real situation regarding the effect of corporate activity upon the external environment and the consequent implications for the future. One of the effects of persuading that corporate activity is sustainable is that the cost of capital for the firm is reduced as investors are misled into thinking that the level of risk involved in their investment is lower than it actually is. We analyse the effects of this misrepresentation and argue for a fuller debate about sustainability.

AB Is corporate social responsibility (CSR) linked to performance-related instrumentality or real moral concerns? Does CSR create resource advantages? Reasons for and results of CSR remain unclear. We choose a leading retail company in a Confucian, collectivist, and high power distance society and ask whether managers are naturally oriented toward societal actions. We study managerial perceptions regarding the importance and the performance of CSR in relation to other management factors. Drawing on Hunt's (2000, A General Theory of Competition: Resources, Competences, Productivity, Economic Growth (Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA)) resource advantage theory, we find that the perceived importance of CSR is only fair vis-A -vis other management factors, but its high performance makes it a core resource for the company.

TI THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SHAREHOLDER
   VALUE: AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS
SO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Do shareholders gain when managers disperse corporate resources through activities classified as corporate social responsibility (CSR)? Strategy scholars have recently developed a theoretical model that links such activities to shareholder value when a firm suffers a negative event; we test key portions of this theory of the 'insurance-like' property of CSR activity. We posit that Such activity leads to positive attributions from stakeholders, who then temper their negative judgments and sanctions toward firms because of this goodwill. We extend the risk management model by theorizing that some types of CSR activities will be more likely to create goodwill and offer insurance-like protection than other types. We delineate several firm and event specific and of characteristics that we expect to influence the link between CSR activities and an insurance effect. We then test our model using an event study of 178 negative legal/regulatory actions against firms throughout the 11 years from 1993-2003. We find that participation in institutional CSR activities-those aimed at a firm's secondary stakeholders or society at large-provides an 'insurance-like' benefit, while participation in technical CSRs-those activities targeting a firm's trading partners-yields no such benefits. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings for future theorizing and research into the economic value of CSR engagement. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Institutional Structure and Firm Social Performance in Transitional
   Economies: Evidence of Multinational Corporations in China
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB With the expansion of multinational corporations (MNCs), the alarming upsurge in widely publicized and notable corporate scandals involving MNCs in emerging markets has begun to draw both academic and managerial attention to look beyond home market practices to the pressing concern of CSR in emerging markets. Previous studies on CSR have focused primarily on Western markets, reserving limited discussions in addressing the issue of MNC attitudes and CSR practices in their emerging host markets abroad. Despite this incongruity in academic response to CSR in emerging markets, managers of multinational companies continue to face mounting and most often conflicting pressures to weigh among multiple strategic CSR responses in emerging markets. Such a task is often further complicated by the complexity of varying business norms and standards, regulatory environments, and stakeholder demands for CSR across national boundaries. With such a challenge in mind, I attempt to examine the explanatory factors in leading MNCs, otherwise recognized for accountability and integrity in their home markets, to employ inconsistent or negligent practices under CSR pressure in Chinese emerging economy. Preliminary findings reveal that discrepancies exist in how MNCs perform in CSR in home countries versus in host countries. While MNCs do have much to improve, the institutional environment in the emerging market, including the legal framework and the ethical culture, also needs to be improved by the host country governments, the industry associations, and local firms. Meanwhile, media interest and journalists, NGOs, third party monitors, industry stakeholders as well as consumer advocacy groups can raise the visibility of MNC's contradictory practices between their origin nations and countries with emerging economies and offer the pressures and incentives for MNCs to amend their ethical shortcomings. This article also suggests implications for both theory and practice.

TI The Trouble with Being Average
SO MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Are corporate social responsibility programs beneficial to companies when they undertake overseas expansion? To address that question, the authors analyzed both financial and corporate social performance data for more than 800 U.S. public companies. In particular, the researchers set out to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and profitable international sales. The researchers found that those companies that had low or high levels of corporate social responsibility had significantly greater success internationally than those with moderate levels of corporate social responsibility. The authors suggest that companies with high levels of social performance may benefit internationally from their good reputation for corporate social responsibility, and companies with low levels may attain cost advantages from overseas expansion. However, companies in between may be "stuck in the middle" - and unable to obtain a competitive advantage internationally from their corporate social responsibility programs. Since retrenching from existing corporate social responsibility efforts can be viewed negatively by existing stakeholders, the authors recommend that companies that are "stuck in the middle" rethink their overseas corporate social responsibility programs - either to de-emphasize competitive advantage or to increase the programs' impact.

TI Corporate social responsibility and consumers' response: the missing
   linkage
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to explain why corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity leads to different consumers' responses, especially why, in some cases, CSR activity might backfire on the company.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a review of previous literature, the aspects of a CSR activity and the contrasting objectives that may influence consumers' responses are discussed. Several propositions are put forward.
   Findings - The structure of a CSR activity, mainly including type of issue/cause, its form, timing and commitment, leads to consumers' different attributions, which in turn leads to consumers' different responses to the firm. Also, consumers make attributions about a firm's CSR activity in terms of the contrast effect between the firm's corporate social performance (CSP) and other objectives for reference, such as the firm's CSR ability, its past CSP, its negative social impact of operation and other firms' CSR activities. Moreover, even though consumers can make positive attribution to a firm's CSR activity, the significant contrast effect of it against the objectives might also lead to consumers making negative responses.
   Research limitations/implications - Given the complex psychological processes of consumers, it is not known if there are other components of a CSR activity and other contrasting objectives that might influence consumers' responses.
   Originality/value - The paper helps business managers to realize the risks embedded in CSR activities, and helps them to use CSR strategically to promote business goals by carefully considering the mix of components of CSR activity and the fit with other contrasting objectives.

TI Applying asset-based community development as a strategy for CSR: a
   Canadian perspective on a win-win for stakeholders and SMEs
SO BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB In the December 2006 edition of Harvard Business Review, Michael Porter and Mark Kramer argue that by approaching corporate social responsibility (CSR) based on corporate priorities, strengths and abilities, firms can develop socially and. scally responsible solutions to current CSR issues, which will provide operational and competitive advantages. We agree that an effective approach to CSR includes a mapping of strategy, risk and opportunity. However, we also caution that the identification of these to the exclusion of societal input may not be to the corporation's advantage. Instead, an investment in both strategic analysis and social capital can pay off from a social and an organizational standpoint. Compared with their larger counterparts, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) frequently have stronger relationships with their internal and external stakeholders that foster the development of social capital. As such, we believe that the sector offers a unique opportunity to identify additional models and frameworks in order to approach a strategic CSR model as espoused by Porter and Kramer. This paper explores a case study of one Canadian SME that uses a community development framework called Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) for its CSR programming. Because ABCD relies heavily on the development and maintenance of social capital and can be utilized to attain set objectives, we propose that it provides a supplementary framework through which the arguments of Porter and Kramer can be expanded. In applying the ABCD framework for CSR, we can begin to establish a programme that supports strategy, integrates employees and stakeholders towards a common vision, and creates unique and sustainable alternatives towards the resolution of social and corporate goals.

TI Investigating CSR communication in SMEs: a case study among Danish
   middle managers
SO BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB This paper seeks to analyse small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) managers' representations of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CSR communication in a corporate communication perspective. The basic question is: how strategic is CSR communication in SMEs? Corporate communication and CSR theories are used to establish an ideal typology of CSR concepts informing an analysis of qualitative data in the form of interviews with three middle managers in two Danish SMEs. A CSR communication model published earlier by the authors is challenged from a SME perspective. Results from an Internet-based questionnaire survey of 1071 SMEs pave the way for the analysis. Our analysis shows that SME managers clearly have an inside-out approach to CSR, with a strong emphasis on the internal (corporate culture) dimension. However, SMEs and/or SME managers tend not to communicate externally about the CSR activities of the company. Based on these findings, the paper argues that CSR communication in SMEs is challenged by the global economy and is under revision. The contribution of the paper is to provide an insight into SMEs' present stage in relation to a possible future approach to strategic CSR communication. The paper also reminds us that SMEs have no interest in turning their local and authentic practice into a forced marketing and branding exercise, leaving them with an artificial picture of who they are and strive to be in the future. They should keep on acting locally but force themselves to think globally.

TI Hotels on fire: investigating consumers' responses and perceptions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the consumer responses associated with crises in the hotel industry. More precisely, the current research explores the factors that affect consumer attitudes (i.e. impressions, perceived social responsibility, and future purchases) during a hotel crisis.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment was conducted relying on four factors: the hotel's reputation, the extent of the crisis, external effects from regulatory agencies, and press and organisational response. Respondents were randomly assigned to 36 treatment groups (three levels of crisis extent x two levels of hotel corporate reputation x two levels of external effects x three levels of hotel response). Scenarios were developed, each describing one of the 36 treatments.
   Findings - The results revealed that reputation, external effects and organisational response significantly influenced consumers. Specifically, consumers were more likely to have a positive impression of a hotel in crisis, to perceive the hotel as being more socially responsible, and to revisit the hotel when it was highly reputed, accepted responsibility, and was viewed favourably by the media. The extent of the crisis was found to be an insignificant factor.
   Practical implications - Hotel managers could incorporate the results of this study into their crisis management plans. As consumer attitudes are explored, the hotel might begin to achieve more effective crisis management strategies.
   Originality/value - There is a lack of research investigating hotel crisis management from the customer's perspective. By adopting effective crisis management practices, hotel managers could reduce the negative outcomes of crises such as fires.

TI Supply chain networks with corporate social responsibility through
   integrated environmental decision-making
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB In this paper we develop a framework for the modeling and analysis of supply chain networks with corporate social responsibility through integrated environmental decision-making. We consider the multicriteria decision-making behaviour of the various decision-makers ( manufacturers, retailers, and consumers), which includes the maximization of net returns, the minimization of emissions ( waste), and the minimization of risk. Increasing levels of social responsibility activities between decision-makers are assumed to reduce transaction costs, waste, as well as risk. We derive the optimality conditions, define the equilibrium state for the supply chain network, and derive the equivalent finite-dimensional variational inequality, the solution of which yields the equilibrium product flows transacted between the tiers of the supply chain network as well as the nodal prices. We then utilize the variational inequality formulation to provide qualitative properties of the equilibrium flow and price patterns and to propose a computational scheme, which is then applied to compute the solution to several numerical examples.

TI Global branding and strategic CSR: an overview of three types of
   complexity
SO INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REVIEW
AB Purpose - There is general agreement that global brands should ensure that they incorporate social responsibility. To do this properly, organisations must understand what it means to be socially responsible and how they can leverage their actions. The paper proposes consideration of three distinct areas: the range of social responsibility issues, what the organisations actually do and how to leverage those corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions. This paper seeks to conceptually develop these three areas of complexity Issue, Organisational and Communication - as it is only after organisations understand these three areas that they can effectively leverage socially responsible activities in their brands.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research undertakes a review and synthesis of the academic, practitioner and industry literature examining CSR and the brand, addressing the three areas of complexity - issue, organisational and communication.
   Findings - The research finds that within these three areas of complexity there are a number of sub-issues that must be addressed if CSR is to be strategically integrated into a global brand. This includes sub-issues associated with social issue complexity (identification, heterogeneity, measurement, and interpretation); organizational complexity (overall corporate brand, multiple products and brands, functional activities, and supply chain); and communication complexity (intensity of action/positioning, communicating action, types of programs utilised, and integration issues.) It thus provides an agenda for future research.
   Research limitations/implications - There is limited academic literature examining how global organisations incorporate CSR activities into their brand and the research proposes the issues that need to be considered when integrating CSR into branding strategy. Future research needs to be undertaken to explore the internal processes that global firms use to develop their CSR positioning strategies and some research propositions for future research are proposed, Additionally further exploration of each of the issues (and sub-issues) identified in this paper is warranted, and some suggestions are made for this.
   Practical implications - The results of this study show that developing a CSR leveraged brand in a consistent way that is salient to all stakeholders is no simple task for global organisations. By considering the three areas of complexity developed here organisations will be able to better understand and align their activities in line with CSR related issues. Being global means that organisations will likely need to ensure they address the highest set of global expectations, as any lower level may be criticised as being less than appropriate.
   Originality/value - The paper develops the sub-issues of issue, organisational and communication complexity associated with global brands' CSR activities. This strategic perspective goes beyond focusing on the tactical activities undertaken or the philosophical issue of whether CSR should be undertaken. The work therefore allows global organisations to look at CSR more strategically as a branding issue.

TI Corporate Reputation: Multidisciplinary Richness and Search for a
   Relevant Definition
SO INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
AB Corporate reputation management is a hot topic both in academic and business world. Rising sophistication of stakeholders and environment, sharp competition, growing demand for corporate transparency and social responsibility determined increase in caring about corporate reputation with new challenge of 21st century: not just caring intuitively of it, but managing it- an issue that was considered for a long time to be unmeasurable and unmanageable - systematically and purposefully.
   In academic world corporate reputation is rather a fresh concept with scare comprehensive researches both in theoretical and empirical levels. It should be admitted that, despite universal acknowledgment of the importance of corporate reputation and its great potential to impact corporate strategy success, corporate reputation as a research object still lacks deeper conceptualizing. Due to fragmentary research and lack of multidisciplinary approach, the question what is reputation, and what is not, may appear not so clear and simple as it may seem (Mahon, 2002). Therefore, ascertaining principal definitions in this field is the first step towards starting up further researches of corporate reputation, its measuring and managing.
   The paper presents discussion and critical review of the interpretations of the concept of corporate reputation in different disciplines - psychology, sociology, impression management, economy, marketing, public relations, business strategy, human resource management - and highlights its exceptional multidisciplinary richness and bare agreement among researchers on what its real range is.
   Obviously, every discussed discipline brings meaningful input to seeking integrative approach to corporate reputation: from explaining its role and potential in the market up to researching the processes of establishment and analyzing a company's abilities to shape its reputation. On the base of retrospective analysis of definitions of corporate reputation, some trends in development of the definition are presented and the principal keywords ascertained. With reference to them, corporate reputation is defined as a socially transmissible overall company's evaluation settled among stakeholders over a long period of time, that represents expectations for the company's actions and level of trustworthiness, favorability and acknowledgement in comparison with its rivals.
   Revealing relational differences between corporate reputation and image is presented as another step in seeking comprehensive definition of corporate reputation for the two constructs are the fuzziest ones. The differences and links between the two constructs are interpreted by researchers far not alike. Yet the following key dimensions separating the constructs might be pointed out: duration of establishment, target, and instruments of creating ones, deepness of perception and abilities to change it. Corporate image is due to one's sudden associations of a company, whereas reputation is deep, settled over a period of time belief in a company's abilities to act in one or another way.

TI The FairWear Campaign: An Ethical Network in the Australian Garment
   Industry
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB In many parts of the world, homework is a form of labour characterised by precariousness, lack of regulation, and invisibility and lack of protection of the workers who are often amongst the world's poorest and most exploited. Homework is spreading, due to firm practices such as outsourcing. The analysis and understanding of complex corporate networks may assist with the identification and protection of those most at risk within the supply chain network. It can also expose some of the key ethical issues and dilemmas of supply chain management and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Based on a case-study of the Australian FairWear Campaign (FWC), this article identifies an ethical network that aims to increase corporate accountability (CA) via greater transparency in corporate supply chains and improve work conditions for homeworkers and increase their recognition in the supply chain.

TI "Too Good to be True!". The Effectiveness of CSR History in Countening
   Negative Publicity
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Corporate crises call for effective communication to shelter or restore a company's reputation. The use of corporate social responsibility (CSR) claims may provide an effective tool to counter the negative impact of a crisis, but knowledge about its effectiveness is scarce and lacking in studies that consider CSR communication during crises. To help fill this gap, this study investigates whether the length of company's involvement in CSR matters when it uses CSR claims in its crisis communication as a means to counter negative publicity. The use of CSR claims in crisis communication is more effective for companies with a long CSR history than for those with a short CSR history, and consumer skepticism about claims lies at the heart of this phenomenon.

TI Company Support for Employee Volunteering: A National Survey of
   Companies in Canada
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Company support for employee volunteerism (CSEV) benefits companies, employees, and society while helping companies meet the expectations of corporate social responsibility (CSR). A nationally representative telephone survey of 990 Canadian companies examined CSEV through the lens of Porter and Kramer's (2006, 'Strategy and society: the link between competitive advantage and corporate social responsibility', Harvard Business Review, 78-92.) CSR, model. The results demonstrated that Canadian companies passively support employee volunteerism in a variety of ways, such as allowing employees to take time off without pay (71%) or adjusting their work schedules (78%). These Responsive CSR efforts contribute to the company's value chain by enhancing employee morale, a perceived CSEV benefit. More active forms of support requiring company time or money are less common; for example, 29% allow time off with pay. Companies perceive that support for employee volunteering enhances their public image, a Responsive CSR strategy when employed to ameliorate a damaged reputation or a Strategic CSR strategy when contributing to a competitive position. A minority perceive challenges like covering the workload. Many companies target and/or exclude particular causes and link CSEV efforts with other philanthropic donations, suggesting a Strategic CSR application of CSEV. Where programs exist, they frequently are neither tracked nor evaluated, suggesting that companies are not using these programs as strategically as they might.

We integrate Hargrave and Van de Ven's (2006, Academy of Management Review 31(4), 864-888) Collective Action Model with capacity development literature to develop a framework that can be used to clarify the nature of CSR. involvement in capacity development, help identify alternative CSR response options, consider expected impacts of these options on stakeholders, and highlight trade-offs across alternative CSR. investments. Our framework encompasses CSR. program investments in the capacities of individuals, organizations, and collaborations, as also their impact on the larger enabling environment. We then use this framework to provide descriptive evidence of two implementations: (1) The PhD Project, whose mission is to increase the diversity of corporate America by increasing the diversity of business school faculty, and (2) Involve, the community involvement program at KPMG, one of the Big Four Accounting firms. We discuss implications of our framework for managerial practice and future research.

TI The Missing Link Between Corporate Social Responsibility and Consumer
   Trust: The Case of Fair Trade Products
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper investigates the link between the consumer perception that a company is socially oriented and the consumer intention to buy products marketed by that company. We suggest that this link exists when at least two conditions prevail: (1) the products sold by that company comply with ethical and social requirements; (2) the company has an acknowledged commitment to protect consumer rights and interests. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a survey among the clients of retail chains offering Fair Trade products. The results show that socially oriented companies can successfully leverage their reputation to market products with high symbolic values.

AB This research investigated Philip Morris' crisis communication management strategies during the 1990s through the study of its CEO's speeches. This analysis explored the company's maneuvers to camouflage controversies in acceptable social expectations. Pairing framing theory with centering resonance analysis, this research found 3 distinct frames: profitable multinational (1994-1996), litigation target (1997-1998), and corporate good citizen (1999-2001). Avoidance of talk about health issues indicated the company's strategic adaptation to a shifting legal and public opinion climate, as it sought to authenticate its right to do business by reframing the notion of corporate responsibility away from healthy products and toward high-price philanthropy.

TI Corporate citizenship in football: delivering strategic benefits through
   stakeholder engagement
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain that corporate citizenship refers to the specific activities that an organisation engages in to meet social obligations, and which has become an issue of growing importance within the business community. A key area in academic literature concentrates on justifying corporate citizenship initiatives to the corporate sector by illustrating a range of strategic benefits that a firm can achieve. This study is located within this body of work and aims to illustrate the strategic benefits that a football club can gain from the implementation of corporate citizenship activities through the community trust model of governance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study draws from qualitative primary and secondary data gathered from Charlton Athletic and Brentford football clubs.
   Findings - Analysis of the data resulted in the identification of six strategic benefits that a football club can realise through the creation of a community trust model of governance. These are the removal of commercial and community tensions; reputation management; brand building, local authority partnerships; commercial partnerships; and player identification.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper considers the importance of these findings for a generic business audience, discussing how organisations can also benefit from the creation of partnerships with football clubs focused on the delivery of corporate citizenship initiatives.
   Practical implications - The paper provides information regarding the application of management practice evident in football to other forms of business Organisation,
   Originality/value - The paper is the first to consider how corporate citizenship initiatives in football can assist firms in other sectors to achieve a range of strategic benefit.

CL Brunel Univ, London, ENGLAND
HO Brunel Univ
AB Purpose - Corporate marketing is a marketing and management paradigm which synthesises practical and theoretical insights from corporate image and reputation, corporate identity, corporate communications and corporate branding, among other corporate-level constructs. The purpose of this paper is to explain the nature and relevance of corporate marketing and to detail the antecedents of the territory.
   Design/methodology/approach - Via the adoption of a quadrivium; a traditional classical approach to the acquisition of knowledge, the paper shows how organisations can be faced by Apocalyptical scenarios through a failure to accord sufficient attention to one or more dimensions of the corporate marketing mix; explains why the emergence of corporate level constructs such as corporate image, identity, branding communications and reputation represents, both individually and collectively, the Advent of corporate marketing; details the various integrative initiatives in corporate design, corporate communications and identity studies which, together with the incremental augmentation of the marketing philosophy, find their natural denouement in the Epiphany of corporate marketing; and describes the 6Cs of the corporate marketing mix and reflects on possible future directions in organisational marketing.
   Findings - The paper reveals the efficacy of adopting an organisation-wide corporate marketing philosophy to management decision makers and scholars.
   Practical implications - Drawing on the marketing/management theory of identity alignment policy the paper accords attention to each dimension of the corporate marketing mix and ensures that they are in meaningful as well as in dynamic alignment.
   Originality/value - The practical utility of corporate marketing is explicated by making reference to case vignettes, and various marketing and non-marketing literatures.

SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
CT 10th Symposium of the International-Corporate-Identity-Group
CY NOV, 2007
CL Brunel Univ, London, ENGLAND
HO Brunel Univ
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the importance of corporate reputation to the management of contemporary organisations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of survey research and case studies. The paper is informed by corporate image and reputation research undertaken for major international corporations, governments and NGOs in the UK and in countries throughout the world dating back to the late 1960s.
   Findings - The paper finds that corporate image is an important factor in the success or failure of virtually all major organisations; corporate reputation is the synthesis of many factors: the brand(s) image, the products (and/or services) class image(s), the brand user(s) image, the image of the country of perceived ownership of a corporation, and the corporate culture/personality; corporate reputations can be measured, and changes in corporate reputations can be tracked; and corporate responsibility is replacing corporate social responsibility as an increasingly important factor in how people regard the corporate reputation of organisations.
   Practical implications - Policy makers should actively research and manage their corporate reputation. Familiarity breeds favourability, not contempt. All too often senior managers and their advisers (brand and corporate consultants, design consultants, advertising and public relations advisers, etc.), who have responsibility for the organisation's corporate reputation, muddle the distinctions between corporate reputation, corporate image. corporate identity, corporate personality, corporate culture, and other ways by which the elements of the corporate reputation are defined, and therefore used and measured.
   Originality/value - The paper shares some of the lessons learned from 40 years' experience of MORI. The paper also marshals insights from the published output, lectures, and image-modelling work.

TI Assessing the greenness effort for European firms A resource efficiency
   perspective
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is twofold: first, to explore whether a linkage between environmental effects and financial performance exists; and second, to investigate whether firms displaying more environmental effort show a more significantly positive relationship between environmental performance and financial performance than those displaying less green effort.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts correlation analysis of a sample comprising of 51 European companies from 14 industries across 15 countries to investigate the possible relationship between firm environmental performance (including three measures: sustainable value, sustainable value margin, and return to cost ratio) and financial performance.
   Findings - The paper does not find a positive relationship between firm environmental performance and financial performance. Both the Pearson correlations and Spearman's rho are statistically insignificant for both the full sample and the carbon-intensive sectors. When the lag effect on firm financial performance is considered, the result remains the same. The result suggests that corporate good guys in Europe do not necessarily reap the rewards of their green effort.
   Research limitations/implications - Future research may investigate the relationship between firm environmental efforts and financial performance across industries with different technologies and product life cycles, or industries with similar pollutions/emissions or usage pattern of natural resources, such as the petroleum industry and the transportation industry.
   Practical implications - Although it was not possible to find a positive association between environmental performance and financial performance, still, being perceived as a green company may improve a company's image and reputation, thus attracting more talented workers and green-conscious customers.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a new perspective on the relationship between firm environmental performance and financial performance in monetary terms by taking a broader view at the environmental outcomes. While past studies only measure firm environmental performance based on damaging impacts to the environment, the research also considers the efficiency of resource use by the firm.

TI Web sites as tools of communication of a "green" company
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is first, to review current literature on corporate identity, image and reputation; second, to analyse the "green reputation" on a sample of Slovene companies based on their web sites and third, to present implications for companies and further research.
   Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis and discourse analysis were used to examine sections of web sites related to sustainable development of 20 Slovene companies representing the pharmaceutical, chemical, energy, food production, retailing, automotive, construction, logistics, sales of oil products and domestic appliance industries.
   Findings - The web sites of 20 Slovene companies studied show that all companies present their values about environment protection and social responsibility, which they relate to sustainable development. However, "green" identity is not fully exploited in terms of being used as a distinctive feature of a company and as such it does not sufficiently contribute to gaining competitive advantage for a company.
   Research limitations/implications - Although constituted by all relevant Slovene companies, the sample is limited in size. Further research could be done with a larger sample to test the findings. Different tools and media of marketing communication and a stakeholder survey could confirm the importance of the findings and significance for green reputation development.
   Practical implications - Senior company management can use the findings from the research presented here as a starting-point for the development of corporate reputation as a "green" company through appropriate use of corporate communication.
   Originality/value - The research paper contributes to the scarce literature on green reputation development, which is almost non-existent with regard to non-multinational. companies from post-transition and transition economies. The paper also reveals new findings about the problem of standardisation within "green" marketing communication.

SO METALURGIA INTERNATIONAL
AB Based on stakeholders' theory, this paper aims to confront the academic definitions of Corporate Social Responsibility with the benefits of its practices by bringing forward a very important element: corporate reputation. A company's commitments in favor of the socially responsible behavior can be in the some time the basis of a competitive differentiation strategy and the support for a communication policy towards social stakeholders. Responsible practices bring benefits to the companies: financial performance, risk forecasting, competitive advantage, image, brand and reputation. Once created, reputation has to be maintained. Reputation is the result of the deep value-based attitude. Not all sectors benefit from the same level of reputation. According to the Reputation Institute, the reputation of on organization depends in the some time on its own actions but also on the stakeholders' perception.

AB Certain environmental and social behaviours have caused an increase in the social pressure felt by corporations when doing business. To palliate this pressure, companies have generated a means of legitimising their behaviour: the reporting or corporate social responsibility. The objective of this article is to test for the existence of relations between certain characteristics of the board of directors and the reporting of corporate social information. The results obtained show an important effect of the independence and diversity of the board in reporting practices, the independent members being the main promoters of such initiatives. On the contrary, board activity and the reputation of its chairman have no effect, whereas the diversity of the organization signifies a move backward in different stages of the process.

TI Supply management ethical responsibility: reputation and performance
   impacts
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - There is a lack of extensive research related to the immediate consequences of supply management ethical responsibility (SMER) and the moderating and/or mediating factors that strengthen or weaken its consequences. Although the underlying presumption is that companies no longer have the luxury of ignoring the importance of SMER, the lack of empirical research of SMER's impact on supply management performance (SMP) reflects the need for research that draws on and empirically tests established theories concerning the role of corporate ethics within the context of supply management (SM). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of SMER and strategic supply management skills on SM perceived reputation and performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modeling is employed to investigate the hypothesized relationships. A sample of 162 purchasing managers provided the data via survey.
   Findings - Strategic supply management skills and perceived reputation have a positive direct impact on performance. SMER is not directly affected by skills and has an indirect impact on performance through its positive relationship with perceived reputation.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that SMER is limited in its ability to predict performance, but is a valuable component of building SM perceived reputation. Firms should not ignore SMER, as it may provide strategic marketing advantage as an order qualifier or limiting criterion.
   Originality/value - This paper investigates the interplay among several important determinants of supply chain performance, including the greatly under-studied ethics construct.

TI Current status of CSR in the realm of supply management: the case of the
   Korean electronics industry
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is two-fold: to survey research on supply management and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reported over the past two decades; and to carry out an empirical study of the current status of supply management and CSR in the Korean electronics industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an explorative approach, wherein "triangulation" is adopted, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. A questionnaire survey with a 132-company sample is employed as a quantitative method and the telephone interviews with 23 samples are used as a qualitative method. By adopting a triangulation approach, rich data and explanatory power can be obtained to answer the research question.
   Findings - The results of the study show that "environmental" pressures and standards are widely accepted and implemented for supply management in the Korean electronics industry. However, "social" pressures and standards are still not commonly used and there is a lack of implementation in the entire supply chain in the industry. The main reason for adopting CSR standards is to identify risks and problems in the supply chain, and to avoid or at least reduce the consequences for the final manufacturer. Although most manufacturers in the Korean electronics industry demand certified environmental standards such as ISO 14001 from their suppliers, there is generally a lack of integration of social standards in supplier management or requirements.
   Practical implications - Companies today face a growing number of restrictions from national legislations and international standards influencing the environment, labour standards, and human rights issues. Within the Korean electronics industry as a whole there appears to be consensus that it is not easy being "socially responsible". Vague notions about CSR issues for supply management practices have not provided suppliers with adequate guidance as they seek to improve their performance vis-a-vis company standards. The development of evaluation standards to assess suppliers can be a critical factor in improving a firm's performance. Another critical factor is documenting all CSR activities for external requirements such as auditors.
   Originality/value - This study is the first empirical attempt to explore CSR adoption and implementation in supply management in the Korean electronics industry.

TI Factors Influencing Social Responsibility Disclosure by Portuguese
   Companies
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This study compares the Internet (corporate web pages) and annual reports as media of social responsibility disclosure (SRD) and analyses what influences disclosure. It examines SRD on the Internet by Portuguese listed companies in 2004 and compares the Internet and 2003 annual reports as disclosure media. The results are interpreted through the lens of a multi-theoretical framework. According to the framework adopted, companies disclose social responsibility information to present a socially responsible image so that they can legitimise their behaviours to their stakeholder groups and influence the external perception of reputation. Results suggest that a theoretical framework combining legitimacy theory and a resource-based perspective provides an explanatory basis for SRD by Portuguese listed companies.

TI Regulating FDI in weak African states: a case study of Chinese copper
   mining in Zambia
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB China's engagement With African countries is growing rapidly, spanning trade, investment and development cooperation. Some observers have suggested that poor operating standards among Chinese investors may contribute to the social ills associated with extractive industries and undermine host countries' sustainable development. Drawing on case study data from the copper mining sector ill Zambia, this paper argues that the economic and political context surrounding Chinese investment risks undermining the effectiveness of local environmental, social and fiscal regulation. The analysis first explores particular characteristics of large-scale Chinese investment, including the prevalence of state-led financing and the challenges of effectively monitoring overseas Chinese projects. It proceeds to place these characteristics within the host country regulatory context, which in the case of Zambia features significant capacity constraints, political interventionism and a pervasive lack of transparency. The paper argues that, within a weak regulatory setting, Chinese investment may pose significant challenges for effective business regulation. Yet the resulting state-firm dynamics are by no means exclusive to Chinese investment. Rather, it is host country regulatory characteristics, in combination with certain features of investors' corporate governance, that together herald a new set of challenges for business regulation in developing African countries.

TI Does It Pay to Be Green? A Systematic Overview
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB The conventional wisdom concerning environmental protection is that it comes at an additional cost imposed on firms, which may erode their global competitiveness. However, during the last decade, this paradigm has been challenged by a number of analysts (e.g., Porter & van der Linde, 1995), who have argued basically that improving a company's environmental performance can lead to better economic or financial performance, and not necessarily to an increase in cost. The aim of this paper is to review empirical evidence of improvement in both environmental and economic or financial performance. We systematically analyze the mechanism involved in each of the following channels of potential revenue increase or cost reduction owing to better environmental practices: (a) better access to certain markets; (b) differentiating products; 0 (c) selling pollution-control technology; (d) risk management and relations with external stakeholders; (e) cost of material, energy, and services; (f) cost of capital; and (g) cost of labor. In each case, we try to identify the circumstances most likely to lead to a "win-win" Situation, i.e., better environmental and financial performance. We also provide a diagnostic of the type of firms most likely to reap Such benefits.

TI Exploring the Moderating Effect of Financial Performance on the
   Relationship between Corporate Environmental Responsibility and
   Institutional Investors: Some Egyptian Evidence
SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Much of the existing literature has argued that those firms that invest in environmental initiatives attract more institutional investors. A noticeable problem with these studies is the assumption that the relationship between institutional investors and corporate environmental responsibility is a monotonic relationship that does not vary with firm financial performance. Initial findings of this study demonstrated that corporate environmental responsibility exerted a positive and significant coefficient on institutional ownership. However, when an interaction term between environmental responsibility and financial performance was included, the results verified that corporate environmental responsibility has a neutral impact on the preferences of institutional investors. Moreover, by classifying firms into two sub-groups, according to their financial performance, environmental responsibility was found to have a positive and significant impact on institutional ownership only when financial performance is high.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS

Manufacturers and retailers determine their production quantities, transaction quantities, and the amount of social responsibility activities they want to pursue that maximize net return, minimize emission, and minimize risk over the planning horizon. We investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers and compute the equilibrium pattern of product outputs, transactions, prices, and levels of social responsibility activities. The paper provides insights concerning the optimal allocation of resources to CSR activities when considering a multiperiod time frame. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Political Roots of Corporate Social Responsibility
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This article argues that whether and how a firm chooses to adopt Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives is conditional in part upon the domestic political institutional structures present in its home market. It demonstrates that economic globalization has increased the pressure applied to companies to develop CSR policies that might help overcome specific governance gaps associated with the globalization phenomenon. Drawing upon an examination of domestic institutions and overall political structure, it argues that the political conditions and expectations present in a company's home market will condition whether a firm might pursue CSR activity. For home markets, it is posited that perceived electoral salience will be filtered through government type and ideology, and state/societal structures will influence if and how firms will use CSR. Specific arguments are developed from these categorizations. The article concludes with a discussion of how researchers might further explore links between CSR, domestic political structures, and corporate political activity.

AB The objective of this article is double: first, to analyze, using a descriptive analysis, the main differences in the level and components of social behaviour between European and North American firms and, second, to contrast empirically, using a multiple linear regression model, whether the motives behind corporate social behaviour are different depending on the region or country of the firm. With this aim, an indicator of social behaviour (termed effort in sustainability) has been constructed by aggregating the firm's social effort with customers, employees, community and environment for a sample of the 40 European and North American companies most highly reputed in the years 2003 and 2004. The results obtained indicate that the region or country of the firm influences the level, components and motivation of its social behaviour.

TI CSR, Transparency and the Role of Intermediate Organisations
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Transparency is a crucial condition to implement a CSR policy based on the reputation mechanism. The central question of this contribution is how a transparency policy ought to be organised in order to enhance the CSR behaviour of companies. Governments endorsing CSR as a new means of governance have different strategies to foster CSR transparency. In this paper we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of two conventional policy strategies: the facilitation policy and the command and control strategy. Using three criteria (efficiency, freedom and virtue) we conclude that both strategies are defective. Most attention is paid to the facilitation strategy since governments nowadays mainly use this. In evaluating this strategy we analyse the Dutch case. As an alternative we introduce a third government policy: the development of a self-regulating sub-system. By construing an analogy with the historical development of corporate financial disclosure, we point out that the vital step in the creation of a self-regulating subsystem is the creation of strong informational intermediate organisations.

TI The Worth of Values - A Literature Review on the Relation Between
   Corporate Social and Financial Performance
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB One of the older questions in the debate about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is whether it is worthwhile for organizations to pay attention to societal demands. This debate was emotionally, normatively, and ideologically loaded. Up to the present, this question has been an important trigger for empirical research in CSR. However, the answer to the question has apparently not been found yet, at least that is what many researchers state. This apparent ambivalence in CSR consequences invites a literature study that can clarify the debate and allow for the drawing of conclusions. The results of the literature study performed here reveal that there is indeed clear empirical evidence for a positive correlation between corporate social and financial performance. Voices that state the opposite refer to out-dated material. Since the beginnings of the CSR debate, societies have changed. We can therefore clearly state that, for the present Western society, "Good Ethics is Good Business."

TI A Survey of Managers' Perceptions of Corporate Ethics and Social
   Responsibility and Actions that may Affect Companies' Success
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This exploratory study examines how managers and professionals regard the ethical and social responsibility reputations of 60 well-known Australian and International companies, and how this in turn influences their attitudes and behaviour towards these organisations. More than 350 MBA, other postgraduate business students, and participants in Australian Institute of Management (Western Australia) management education programmes were surveyed to evaluate how ethical and socially responsible they believed the 60 organisations to be. The survey sought to determine what these participants considered 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' behaviour in organisations to be. The survey also examined how the participants' beliefs influenced their attitudes and intended behaviours towards these organisations. The results of this survey indicate that many managers and professionals have clear views about the ethical and social responsibility reputations of companies. This affects their attitudes towards these organisations which in turn has an impact on their intended behaviour towards them. These findings support the view in other research studies that well-educated managers and professionals are, to some extent, taking into account the ethical and social responsibility reputations of companies when deciding whether to work for them, use their services or buy shares in their companies.

TI Formally shaming white-collar criminals
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB The dust has settled, and the 2001-2002 corporate scandals are in the rearview mirror for most executives and managers. There is, however, still an upward trend in white-collar crime, which can negatively affect everything from investor confidence, to stockholder embarrassment, to the degree to which the public views the firm's social responsibility and reputation. We find that formal shaming sanctions are slowly being added to the traditional punishment options of fines and incarceration for convicted white-collar offenders. Sentencing judges, courts, legislatures, convicted criminals, and the public have little understanding of the deterrence impact, if any, of shaming sanctions. This article attempts to clarify what shaming sanctions are, why white-collar personnel should become more familiar with the array of shaming punishments being utilized, and how shaming sanctions are being used to deal with white-collar offenders.

TI When Does a Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative Provide a
   First-Mover Advantage?
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB Theory and research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) have been concerned primarily with identifying stakeholders, categorizing types of CSR initiatives, and linking corporate social performance to firm performance. In this conceptual article, the authors assess strategic CSR initiatives, inquiring into the conditions that might give rise to a sustainable competitive advantage in social performance. In what circumstances does a firm's CSR initiative create a first-mover advantage, and when should a firm prefer an early- or late-adopter position? Using the resource-based view and the asymmetries approach of first-mover advantages, the authors propose that for a CSR initiative to lead to a sustainable first-mover advantage, it must be central to the firm's mission, provide firm-specific benefits, and be made visible to external audiences. These strategic attributes generate internal sustainability and must be complemented to ensure external defensibility by a firm's ability to assess its environment, manage its stakeholders, and deal with social issues.

TI Psychological antecedents to socially responsible behavior
SO EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB To date, the discussion regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) has primarily addressed organizational rationale and activities. Little has been said about the individual characteristics and behaviors that promote the development of CSR within organizations. In this paper, we propose and test a model to explain individual differences in the propensity to engage in socially responsible behavior (SRB). By linking values, affect and reasoning to managers' propensity to 'do good' and 'do no harm,' we provide a more complete picture of how SRB arises in organizations. A survey of 643 middle managers in five multinational corporations supports our contention that values, affect and reasoning matter for SRB. In particular, self-transcendence values (universalism and benevolence) and positive affect increase the propensity to engage in SRB, as do moral and reputation-based reasoning styles. Moreover, we find that values and affect shape more controlled processes such as moral reasoning. We develop implications for the interaction between the individual and the organization in promoting SRB. European Management Review (2008) 5, 175-190. doi: 10.1057/emr.2008.15

SO JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB This paper provides a critical review of the literature On Socially responsible investments (SRI). Particular to SRI is that both financial goals and social objectives are pursued. Over the past decade. SRI has experienced an explosive growth around the world reflecting the increasing awareness of investors to social. environmental, ethical and corporate governance issues. We argue that there are significant opportunities for future research on the increasingly important area of SRI. A number of questions are reviewed in this paper on the causes and the shareholder-value impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR). the risk exposure and performance of SRI funds and firms. as well as fund Subscription and redemption behavior of SRI investors. We conclude that the existing studies hint but do not unequivocally demonstrate that SRI investors are willing to accept suboptimal financial performance to Pursue social or ethical objectives. Furthermore. the emergence of SRI raises interesting questions for research on corporate finance, asset pricing, and financial intermediation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Stakeholder's preference and rational compliance: A comment on sacconi's
   "CSR as a model for extended corporate governance II: Compliance,

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Lorenzo Sacconi's recent re-statement of his social contract account of business ethics is a major contribution to our understanding of the normative nature of CSR as the expression of a fair multi-party agreement supported by the economic rationality of each participant. However, at one crucial point in his theory, Sacconi introduces the concept of stakeholders' conformist preferences - their disposition to punish the firm if it defects from the agreement, refusing to abide by its own explicit CSR policies and norms. We take issue with him over this concept: we show that the assumption of conformist preferences is a moral premise, and it arguably weakens the normativity of the theory as a whole. As an alternative, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic approach. We draw upon recent applications of evolutionary game theory to moral philosophy (Skyrms, Danielson), and we use a computer simulation of the trust game. According to this approach, the failure of the logic of reputation, which is the problem conformist preferences were introduced to solve, is overcome through the dynamics of interaction.

SO ECONOMIA POLITICA
AB This paper is meant as a discussion of different methodological approaches to the analysis of corporate social responsibility (CSR), sorted Out through a scrutiny of the literature that has emerged from the recent Italian debate. The first stream of literature is embedded in the neo-classical approach that adapts - to the contemporary economic environment - the famous Milton Friedman's statement that the social responsibility of the firm is to make profits (Friedman, 1970). The second stream refers to a neo-contractualist approach, mainly developed by Lorenzo Sacconi (2004; 2005), that can be considered as an insightful application of incomplete contracts theory, strongly characterized by a contractualist-oriented ethical perspective. The third stream is the relational approach developed by Bruni and Zamagni (2004), which takes the issue of social reproduction into account in the description of the economic system, thereby looking at firms as producers of socially provided goods. Finally, we propose an integration between these different perspectives through the adoption of a conventionalist definition of CSR.

AB A variety of stakeholders including investors, corporate managers, customers, suppliers, employees, researchers, and government policy makers have long been interested in the relationship between the financial performance of a corporation and its commitment to business ethics. As a subject of research, the relations between business ethics and corporate valuation has yet to be thoroughly quantified and investigated. This article is an effort to amend this inadequacy by demonstrating a statistically significant association between ethical commitment and corporate valuation measures. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, we have found a significant association between the ethical commitment of Korean companies and their valuation on the Korean stock market. However, the result reveals that the association between ethical commitment and financial performance is not significantly supported.

Specifically, we employ firm-level data for a large sample of U.K. companies drawn from a diverse range of industrial sectors to investigate, given innovation, the determinants of both the probability that the innovation brings reduced environmental impacts and/or improved health and safety, and the strength of this effect. In this connection, we find evidence of a dichotomy between product and process innovations, and roles for firm size, industrial sector, a foreign market presence, access to various information sources (e.g. universities and government research organisations) and the extent to which activities are constrained by regulation. Furthermore, we find a tendency for the influences of many of these factors to vary between older and newer firms.

In this paper 658 articles that appeared in Strategic Management Journal over the 10-year period between 1996 and 2005 are reviewed for business ethics focus and content. The results reveal that while business ethics research in Strategic Management Journal is on the rise, the overall focus on this research stream has been limited. The most prominent ethics theme during the review period was environmentalism, accounting for 30% of all ethics articles. Author affiliations, future research directions, and implications are also discussed.

TI Corporate social and financial performance: An extended stakeholder
   theory, and empirical test with accounting measures
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Although agreement on the positive sign of the relationship between corporate social and financial performance is observed in the literature, the mechanisms that constitute this relationship are not yet well-known. We address this issue by extending management's stakeholder theory by adding insights from psychology's prospect decision theory and sociology's resource dependence theory. Empirically, we analyze an extensive panel dataset, including information on disaggregated measures of social performance for the S&P 500 in the 1997-2002 period. In so doing, we enrich the extant literature by focusing on stakeholder heterogeneity, perceptional framing, and disaggregated measures of corporate social performance.

TI Social reporting by companies listed on the alternative investment
   market
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB While the existing literature focuses on the disclosure of social information mainly by large companies, this paper concentrates on the disclosure of social information by small- and medium-sized companies (SME) listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in the U.K. The paper investigates the prevalent view that SMEs are unlikely to report social information due to their financial constraints and the perception that they have very little social conduct on which to report. Our overall evidence illustrates that, contrary to this view, SMEs report social information regardless of their financial constraints, most likely in the same manner as large companies do, because they realise the significance of social reporting in establishing and retaining their corporate reputation.

TI Stakeholder relations and financial performance
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB We analyze how shareholder performance can be associated with stakeholder relations. As such, we try to find out whether there is an association between financial performance and stakeholder relations with respect to different theoretical notions about the firm. Financial performance is operationalized as the financial return of a firm's shares. For stakeholder relations, we look into community involvement, corporate governance, employee relations, environmental conduct, diversity of the workforce, human rights policies and product attributes. We find that the different components of stakeholder relations appear to be associated in a complex manner with shareholder performance. Therefore, it adds value to look closely into the details of stakeholder relations in connection with financial performance. Copyright (C)3 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI The effects of person-organization ethical fit on employee attraction
   and retention: Towards a testable explanatory model
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB An exploratory model is presented as a heuristic to indicate how individual perceptions of corporate reputation (before joining) and corporate ethical values (after joining) generate specific individual organizational senses of fit. The paper suggests that an ethical dimension of person-organization fit may go some way in explaining superior acquisition and retention of staff by those who are attracted to specific organizations by levels of corporate social performance consonant with their ethical expectations, or who remain with them by virtue of better personal ethical fits with extant organizational ethical values. Specifically, the model suggests that individual misfits that arise from ethical expectations that either exceed or fall short of perceived organizational ethical performances lead to problematic acquisition and retention behavioural outcomes.

TI Turning Stakeseekers Into Stakeholders A Political Coalition Perspective
   on the Politics of Stakeholder Influence
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB Many firms, especially transnational corporations, find it increasingly difficult to predict and handle conflicts with external interest groups. In addition to a set of established stakeholders, they face a complex arena of newly emerging "stakeseekers" who also claim to have a stake in the corporation's decision making. Corporations seek to establish relationships with such groups to anticipate and prevent conflicts that could otherwise wreak havoc on their reputation. Through stakeholder engagement, stakeseekers may be turned into stakeholders. It has been argued that in the process, critics are simply co-opted. However, corporate objectives are not necessarily monolithic. Conceived as a political coalition of various interests, the structure of the corporation often reflects societal divisions. Parts of the corporation can thus serve as sounding boards for external claims. Referring to the case of Royal Dutch/Shell in particular, this article shows how a political coalition perspective on the corporation may help to understand and analyze the politics of stakeholder influence.

TI Ethical responsibility of firm's marketing activity
SO AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC
AB More and more firms answer to the need to offer policies and directions that help managers to approach the problems of marketing ethics. Business ethics represents a reaction against immoral practices with negative effects in society, but also an awareness of the observance necessity of moral rules in the field of economics. Social responsible marketing imposes that market approach attends firm interests and also those approached. Social responsibility is a tool of assurance for the firm success on long term. More and more companies are concerned in ethical conscience growing up of the managers and workers. The firms have to analyze if their marketing activity is actually ethical and social responsible. It is advisable that organizations conceive corporate policies of marketing ethics that include detailed directions that have to be observed by the staff of the company.
   Ethics and social responsibility need a total engagement of the firm. They have to be a component of the whole firm culture. Ethical values promotion is done by team work and by initiative and the results appear in increasing reputation and organization image.

We propose a new way to look at the relationship between business and society that does not treat corporate success and social welfare as a zero-sum game. Each company can identify the particular set of social problems that it is best equipped with and helps to solve them from which it can gain the greatest competitive benefit. Organizations that make the right choices and build focused, proactive and integrated social initiatives in concert with their core strategies will take the competitive advantage.

TI Dynamics of supply chain networks with corporate social responsibility
   through integrated environmental decision-making
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we develop a dynamic framework for the modeling and analysis of supply chain networks with corporate social responsibility through integrated environmental decision-making. Through a multilevel supply chain network, we model the multicriteria decision-making behavior of the various decision-makers (manufacturers, retailers, and consumers), which includes the maximization of profit, the minimization of emission (waste), and the minimization of risk. We explore the dynamic evolution of the product flows, the associated product prices, as well as the levels of social responsibility activities on the network until an equilibrium pattern is achieved. We provide some qualitative properties of the dynamic trajectories, under suitable assumptions, and propose a discrete-time algorithm which is then applied to track the evolution of the levels of social responsibility activities, product flows and prices over time. We illustrate the model and computational procedure with several numerical examples. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Screening for inter-hospital differences in cesarean section rates in
   low-risk deliveries using administrative data: An initiative to improve
   the quality of care
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB Background: Rising national cesarean section rates (CSRs) and unexplained inter-hospital differences in CSRs, led national and international bodies to select CSR as a quality indicator. Using hospital discharge abstracts, we aimed to document in Belgium (1) inter-hospital differences in CSRs among low risk deliveries, (2) a national upward CSR trend, (3) lack of better neonatal outcomes in hospitals with high CSRs, and (4) possible under-use of CS.
   Methods: We defined a population of low risk deliveries (singleton, vertex, full-term, live born, < 4500 g, > 2499 g). Using multivariable logistic regression techniques, we provided degrees of evidence regarding the observed departure ([relative risk-I]* 100) of each hospital (N = 107) from the national CSR and its trend. To determine a benchmark, we defined three CSR groups (high, average and low) and compared them regarding 1 minute Apgar scores and other neonatal endpoints. An anonymous feedback is provided to the hospitals, the College of Physicians (with voluntary disclosure of the outlying hospitals for quality improvement purposes) and to the policy makers.
   Results: Compared with available information, the completeness and accuracy of the data, regarding the variables selected to determine our study population, showed adequate. Important inter-hospital differences were found. Departures ranged from 65% up to + 75%, and 9 "high CSR" and 13 "low CSR" outlying hospitals were identified. We observed a national increasing trend of 1.019 (95% CI [1.015; 1.022]) per semester, adjusted for age groups. In the "high CSR" group 1 minute Apgar scores < 4 were over-represented in the subgroup of vaginal deliveries, suggesting CSs not carried out for medical reasons. Under-use of CS was also observed. Given their questionable completeness, except Apgar scores, our neonatal results, showing a significant association of CS with adverse neonatal endpoints, are to be cautiously interpreted. Taking the available evidence into account, the "Average CSR" group seemed to be the best benchmark candidate.
   Conclusion: Rather than firm statements about quality of care, our results are to be considered a useful screening. The inter-hospital differences in CSR, the national CS upward trend, the indications of over-use and under-use, the geographically different obstetric patterns and the admission day-related concentration of deliveries, whether or not by CS, may trigger initiatives aiming at improving quality of care.

TI Mechanisms of power and action for cause-related marketing -
   Perspectives of enterprise and non-profit organizations
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - This study aims to examine why cause-related marketing (CM can develop, and how can the social system and enterprise link with nonprofit organization (NPO) to form a closed path to prompt the maximization for three parties' benefits, in order to provide a general framework to explore the mechanisms of power and action for CRM.
   Design/methodology/approach - The logic deduction approach was used for an overview and conceptual paper based on research experience.
   Findings - The paper stresses CRM should be a good marriage between a nonprofit and its sponsorship firm both organizations stand to benefit. Its mechanism of power is the result of the combined effect by the enterprises push, NPO's pull and social system's supervision, and mechanism of action is under the social system's supervision, enterprise linked with NPO to form a closed path.
   Research limitations/implications - A major weakness is that the influences of CRM on the enterprise and the NPO are only explained qualitatively, there are short of some data to test the validity of theories above. Further, investigation into this construct in the context of CRM would be helpful in understanding what are the role and the impact of CRM on firm and NPO in this domain. The main implication is that this study presents an example and direction of how the enterprise, NPO, and social system are able to maximize their economic and social benefits.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to examine the inter mechanisms of CRM from the perspectives of enterprise and NPO. The findings of this study are useful to and provide managerial implications for administrators of enterprise, NPO and social system aiming to make optimal decisions under the dual driven of institutional rationality and economic rationality.

TI An analysis of linkage between economic value added and corporate social
   responsibility
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - Research findings indicate that there is positive relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and company's reputation but relationship between CSR and company's profitability has not been explored in the Indian context. CSR level of business firms in India is increasing in terms of both amount of the disclosure and the number of participating firms. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to explore the link between good financial performance measure and other indicators of corporate responsibility. This paper also aims at studying the trend of disclosure of CSR reporting by Indian companies.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study seeks to investigate the relationship between ethical commitment and financial performance over the four-year period, through statistical regression and correlation analysis. Studies of few Indian companies who have successfully implemented CSR initiatives have also been analyzed to investigate the level and nature of engagement of Indian companies in social responsibility initiatives.
   Findings - It has been reported that there is little evidence that companies with a code of ethics would generate significantly more economic value added (EVA) and market added value (MVA) than those without codes.
   Practical implications - Indian corporations need to develop a proper strategy to integrate CSR goals with stockholders' goals. Top management should create a dedicated CSR team, which should identify the core areas of CSR and strengthen internal practices such as corporate governance, transparency and disclosure issues.
   Originality/value - In the Indian context very few studies have analyzed the linkages between CSR and Organizational profitability. This article presents a new approach to correlate the relationship between CSR and Organizational profitability in terms of EVA and MVA.

TI Self-interest, self-restraint and corporate responsibility for
   nanotechnologies: Emerging dilemmas for modern managers
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB The recent developments in nanotechnology have simultaneously conjured up visions of utopia and dismal images of technological and biological catastrophes. Interestingly, the world of nanoscales has given rise to larger than life ethical dilemmas, challenging the basic assumptions that we hold about ethics, man-machine interface, adoption of new technologies and, fundamentally, the directions of human development. Given the divergence and uncertainties in the assessment of risks and benefits associated with nanotechnology, regulatory oversight in the future is likely to be partial and fragmented. Even where interests converge, the large time-frame needed for standardization of regulation coupled with the varying propensities of countries of the world to understand, assimilate and respond to risk issues increase the difficulties associated with creating appropriate regulatory regimes. In the absence of such controls, it may be necessary to rely on corporations behaving in a socially responsible manner by self-regulating when dealing with the conceptualization, development, use and disposal of nanoparticles. Caught between the reality and rhetoric, corporate managers need to manage trade-offs between corporate advantage and social responsibility in ways that may have a significant bearing on the survival of their firms and the future development of nanotechnology itself. This paper examines the tensions between the self-interest of corporations in exploiting the technology to bring innovative products to the market and self-restraint in exercising ethical choices to secure wider safety and salubrity in the face of scientific uncertainty and public insecurity.

TI Tools for the disempowered? Indigenous leverage over mining companies
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Rather than passively accepting development, some Indigenous communities have forced their demands into corporate decision-making. Accordingly, recognising and responding to community expectations becomes a matter of prudent strategy and 'enlightened self-interest'. This paper examines the case of Century Zinc Mine in Queensland's Gulf of Carpentaria where the miner undertook negotiations and reached agreement with local Indigenous communities. It was later held to account by communities concerned about insufficient implementation of this agreement. Discussion then explores the campaign against Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory, especially why multinational miner Rio Tinto deferred to local community wishes surrounding development. These experiences show that Indigenous communities are most effective in bringing leverage over mining companies when they impact upon profit or future profit (often related to reputation with specific audiences). The parameters and consequent limitations of a company's responsiveness to community demands reinforce fundamental roles for the state as ultimate regulator and provider.

TI Ethnic diversity on top corporate boards: a resource dependency
   perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper examines the presence of ethnic minority (EM) directors on FTSE 100 company boards, following the 2003 Higgs Review, which strongly recommended that more efforts should be made to find talented non-executive directors with diverse backgrounds, including EM individuals. The 20 companies with EM directors are significantly more likely than other boards to have higher market capitalization, a larger workforce and a larger, more independent and gender-diverse board. Their sectors are banking and life assurance, media, pharmaceuticals, energy, chemicals, mining, telecoms, and food and beverage production. The 27 EM directors hold 28 seats, representing 2.4 per cent of all FTSE 100 directorships, almost the same as in 2001, indicating little impact of the 2003 Higgs recommendations. Next, drawing on resource dependency theory, this paper considers the human and social capital of EM directors. They have high levels of human capital, particularly advanced education and considerable social capital from connections to important resources. Even executive directors provide links to public bodies and community influence. Boardroom expertise and linkages acquired through these appointments fit well with challenges faced by companies in the sectors where EM directors have been appointed, particularly relating to globalization, post-colonialism, increased regulation, importance of CSR, reputation, learning and increased connectedness, supporting the resource dependency explanation.

TI What corporate social responsibility activities are valued by the
   market?
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Corporate management is torn between either focusing solely on the interests of stockholders (the neo-classical view) or taking into account the interests of a wide spectrum of stakeholders (the stakeholder theory view). Of course, there need be no conflict where taking the wider view is also consistent with maximising stockholder wealth. In this paper, we examine the extent to which a conflict actually exists by examining the relationship between a company's positive (strengths) and negative (concerns) corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and equity performance. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that managers taking a wider stakeholder perspective will jeopardise the interest of its stockholders. However, our findings do suggest that the market is not only influenced by the independent CSR activities, but also the totality of these activities and that the facets that they value do vary over time. It seems that most recently, the market has valued most firms that satisfied minimum requirements in the areas of diversity and environmental protection but were most proactive in the area of employee-relations.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The relationship between social and financial performance (CSP - FP) has been a main objective in the literature on business management, as it would provide an economic justification for the social investment insofar as it contributes to the creation of value. This relationship has been empirically tested by several authors though without using a theoretical model that sustains this relationship. The aim of this article is to propose a theoretical model of the process of the creation of value from the reputation generated by companies, integrating the factors that have been shown to be more relevant in this process from previous research, in such a way that hypotheses are put forward regarding the existence of this relationship and the factors that determine it. Finally, an empirical test is performed using the 100 most prestigious companies operating in Spain during 2004.

TI The corporate social responsibility of pharmaceutical product recalls:
   An empirical examination of US And UK Markets
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The pressure on companies to practice corporate social responsibility (CSR) has gained momentum in recent times as a means of sustaining competitive advantage in business. The pharmaceutical industry has been acutely affected by this trend. While pharmaceutical product recalls have become rampant and increased dramatically in recent years, no comprehensive study has been conducted to study the effects of announcements of recalls on the shareholder returns of pharmaceutical companies. As product recalls could significantly damage a company's reputation, profitability and brand integrity, this paper investigates the effect on shareholder wealth and the extent to which the adoption of CSR practices by pharmaceutical companies in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the United States (U.S.), the two largest markets for pharmaceutical products in the world, affected market reactions surrounding product recall announcements. The analysis of product recall announcements from 1998 to 2004 compiled from The Pharmaceutical Journal and U.S. Food and Drug Administration enforcement reports revealed marked differences in the way market participants in the two countries responded to news of product recalls. U.S. investors penalised firms according to the severity of product defects while U.K. investors were indifferent. While U.K. investors rewarded product recalls by firms which were not usually CSR-active, U.S. investors punished non-CSR active firms that performed recalls. These observations could pose strategic challenges to pharmaceutical firms operating in both countries.

TI Strategic corporate social responsibility and value creation among large
   firms - Lessons from the Spanish experience
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
AB Can corporate social responsibility (CSR) be a source of good and a wellspring of innovation, competitive advantage and value creation for the firm? Although CEOs and government leaders insist in public that CSR projects create value for the firm, privately they admit that they do not know if CSR pays off. To address this question and drawing on experience for the Spanish context, we test one of the few efforts to model how the strategic management of CSR may contribute to improving firm profitability (Burke and Logsdon, 1996). To do this, we examine the impact of three strategic CSR variables - visibility, appropriability, and voluntarism - on value creation among large Spanish corporations. The conclusions from these findings suggest that managers need to understand how CSR is similar to and different from other traditional corporate market activities if they are to pursue value creation through CSR. We also suggest avenues for future research to explain how CSR may be integrated into firm processes to create resources (assets) and capabilities (routines) that may lead to competitive advantage and superior economic performance.

TI Integration of environmental management with other managerial functions
   of the firm - Empirical effects on drivers of economic performance
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
AB In this paper I analyse the association of the integration at firm level of environmental considerations and other managerial functions with drivers of economic performance. I address the to-date-unresolved question of whether there are differences in the association between integration and different drivers of economic performance, i.e., when are the benefits of integration high and when low? The results are presented for four different drivers of economic performance, which are (1) market-related, (2) image-related, (3) efficiency-related and (4) risk-related. A generally positive, yet varying, association of integration with these performance drivers is confirmed by this first systematic empirical analysis of the effect integration has on drivers of economic performance. Based on the results, implications for managers and ways in which they can make use of the findings, as well as tools that can help integration, are discussed. This paper extends the theoretical literature on integration, which so far has been limited from a managerial perspective in that it has not been much linked to work on managerial tools that can help in achieving integration. The paper thus provides insights for managers into the benefits of integration and suggests innovative means of achieving it that are grounded in management research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Corporate social responsibility an opportunity of competitiveness,
   differentiation, and reputation for small and medium-sized enterprises
SO DYNA
AB This report aims at considering Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to be an opportunity for businesses as an improvement of stake-holders relationships. Small and medium sized enterprises are a fundamental part of advanced economies as they highly contribute to job creation, Gross Domestic Product contribution and employment, therefore, CSR has to be achieved by this key element of the economy and society. SMEs have always been very close to CSR through their traditional local anchoring and its proximity to the community. This report illustrates how can be social responsible issues best attained by the medium and small businesses, in a straightforward and practical approach.

TI Corporate ethical identity as a determinant of firm performance: A test
   of the mediating role of stakeholder satisfaction
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB In this article, we empirically assess the impact of corporate ethical identity (CEI) on a firm's financial performance. Drawing on formulations of normative and instrumental stakeholder theory, we argue that firms with a strong ethical identity achieve a greater degree of stakeholder satisfaction (SS), which, in turn, positively influences a firm's financial performance. We analyze two dimensions of the CEI of firms: corporate revealed ethics and corporate applied ethics. Our results indicate that revealed ethics has informational worth and enhances shareholder value, whereas applied ethics has a positive impact through the improvement of SS. However, revealed ethics by itself (i.e. decoupled from ethical initiatives) is not sufficient to boost economic performance.

TI Ethical purchasing and workers' rights in China: The case of the
   brotherhood of St Laurence
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB As China continues its economic development and integration with the global economy, pressure is building to ensure international enterprises embrace responsible supply chain management and contribute to improved labour and environmental conditions. Despite China's reputation for having a poor regulatory framework, China's labour law is more comprehensive than that of many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. What is lacking is an adequate system of enforcement. This article draws on the experiences of an Australian non-governmental organization (NGO) in dealing with the Chinese optical industry to consider the important question of corporate social responsibility in China.(1) It begins with an overview of the Brotherhood of St Laurence experience and observations in China, examines the challenges and opportunities of responsible supply chain management and ethical purchasing and the impact on workers' rights, and finally looks at implications for an Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA).

TI The contribution of corporate social responsibility to organizational
   commitment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
AB This study investigates the relationship between organizational commitment and employee perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) within a model that draws on social identity theory. Specifically, we examine the impact of three aspects of socially responsible behaviour on organizational commitment: employee perceptions of corporate social responsibility in the community, procedural justice in the organization and the provision of employee training. The relationship between organizational commitment and each aspect of CSR is investigated within a model that distinguishes between genders and includes a set of control variables that is drawn from the commitment literature (Meyer et al., 2002). The analysis is based on a sample of 4,712 employees drawn from a financial services company. The results emphasize the importance of gender variation and suggest both that external CSR is positively related to organizational commitment and that the contribution of CSR to organizational commitment is at least as great as job satisfaction.

TI Sustainable development and corporate performance: A study based on the
   Dow Jones Sustainability Index
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The goal of this paper is to examine whether business performance is affected by the adoption of practices included under the term Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). To achieve this goal, we analyse the relation between CSR and certain accounting indicators and examine whether there exist significant differences in performance indicators between European firms that have adopted CSR and others that have not. The effects of compliance with the requirements of CSR were determined on the basis of firms included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and specific accounting indicators were applied to measure performance. For the purposes of this study, we selected one group of firms belonging to the DJSI and another comprised of firms quoted on the Dow Jones Global Index (DJGI) but not on the DJSI. The sample was made up of two groups of 55 firms, studied for the period 1998-2004. Empirical analysis supports the conclusion that differences in performance exist between firms that belong to the DJSI and to the DJGI and that these differences are related to CSR practices. We find that a short-term negative impact on performance is produced.

TI Social movements as extra-institutional entrepreneurs: The effect of
   protests on stock price returns
SO ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY
AB This paper uses social movement theory to examine one way in which secondary stakeholders outside the corporation may influence organizational processes, even if they are excluded from participating in legitimate channels of organizational change. Using data on activist protests of U. S. corporations during 1962-1990, we examine the effect of protests on abnormal stock price returns, an indicator of investors' reactions to a focal event. Empirical analysis demonstrates that protests are more influential when they target issues dealing with critical stakeholder groups, such as labor or consumers, and when generating greater media coverage. Corporate targets are less vulnerable to protest when the media has given substantial coverage to the firm prior to the protest event. Past media attention provides alternative information to investors that may contradict the messages broadcast by protestors.(center dot).

TI A social contract account for CSR as an extended model of corporate
   governance(II): Compliance, reputation and reciprocity
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This essay seeks to give a contractarian foundation to the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), meant as an extended model of corporate governance of the firm. Whereas, justificatory issues have been discussed in a related paper (Sacconi, L.: 2006b, this journal), in this essay I focus on the implementation of and compliance with this normative model. The theory of reputation games, with reference to the basic game of trust, is introduced in order to make sense of self-regulation as a way to implement the social contract on the multi-fiduciary model of corporate governance. This affords understanding of why self-regulation, meant as mere recourse to a long-run strategy in a repeated trust game, fails. Two basic problems for the functioning of the reputation mechanism are examined: the cognitive fragility problem, and the motivational problem. As regards the cognitive fragilities of reputation (which result from the impact of unforeseen contingencies and from bounded rationality), the paper develops the logic and the structure that self-regulatory norms must satisfy if they are to serve as gap-filling tools with which to remedy cognitive limitations in the reputation mechanism. The motivation problem then arises from the possibility of sophisticated abuse by the firm. Developed in this case is an entirely new application of the theory of conformism-and-reciprocity-based preferences, the result of which is that the stakeholders refuse to acquiesce to sophisticated abuse on the part of the firm.

AB Businesses are eager to present themselves as honest and reliable corporate citizens who care about the overall well-being of society. This article researches whether different role conceptions of businesses regarding social issues are related to their success in dealing with social demands. Do socially active companies have a better social reputation than inactive companies? This relationship is determined by first extracting the social role conceptions of the companies from their Corporate Social Responsibility reports and then comparing this data to their social reputations. The analysis shows that there is indeed a relationship between these two variables. Companies with a broad social role conception score significantly better on their social reputations than companies with a narrow role conception. Social role conceptions therefore matter when dealing with social demands.

TI Corporate social responsibility and social entrepreneurship
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
AB Milton Friedman argued that the social responsibility of firms is to maximize profits. This paper examines this argument for the economic environment envisioned by Friedman in which citizens can personally give to social causes and can invest in profit-maximizing firms and firms that give a portion of their profits to social causes. Citizens obtain social satisfaction from corporate social giving, but corporate giving may not be a perfect substitute for personal giving. The paper presents a theory of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and shows that CSR is costly when it is an imperfect substitute. When investors anticipate the CSR, shareholders do not bear its cost. Instead, the entrepreneurs who form the CSR firms bear the cost. Shareholders bear the cost of CSR only when it is a surprise, and it is to such surprises that Friedman objects. A social entrepreneur is willing to form a CSR firm at a financial loss because either doing so expands the opportunity sets of citizens in consumption-social giving space or there is an entrepreneurial warm glow from forming the firm. Firms can also undertake strategic CSR activities that increase profits, and a social entrepreneur carries strategic CSR beyond profit maximization and market value maximization. The paper also examines the implications of taxes and the effect of the market for control for the sustainability of CSR.

TI The effects of firm size and industry on corporate giving
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Recent downward trends in corporate giving have renewed interest in the factors that shape corporate philanthropy. This paper examines the relationships between charitable contributions, firm size and industry. Improvements over previous studies include an IRS data base that covers a much broader range of firm sizes and industries as compared to previous studies and estimation using an instrumental variable technique that explicitly addresses potential simultaneity between charitable contributions and profitability. Important findings provide evidence of a cubic relationship between charitable giving and firm size and evidence of strong industry effects. The plus-minus-plus regression coefficient sign pattern for the cubic firm size model suggests that small and large firms give more relative to total receipts with lower giving ratios among medium size firms. One interpretation for this finding is that small firms are close to the communities they serve while high visibility creates a need for large firm philanthropy. Strong industry effects provide evidence of inter-industry differences in giving culture and/or different public relations requirements across industries.

TI The relevance of fit in a cause-brand alliance when consumers evaluate
   corporate credibility
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB How well the cause fits with the brand or is congruent has been assumed to be an important variable when selecting a cause partner. This study assesses if consumers' perceptions of the fit between a cause and a brand has a differential impact on attitudes and purchase intentions when the credibility of a firm is low, moderate, or high. A 2 x 3 experimental design which manipulated cause fit and corporate credibility was conducted. Results show that the fit between the cause and the brand does not affect perceptions of attitudes or purchase intentions regardless of the company's level of credibility. The findings suggest that perceptions of corporate credibility may be too complex for one variable such as the fit of a cause-brand alliance to have a strong effect. Thus, marketers may need to rethink fit as a necessary selection criterion for a CBA depending on what their objectives are. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Although corporate reputation has attracted significant attention among marketing scholars, current measures of it do not adequately capture the perceptions of the most important stakeholder group, customers, and often overlook its relationship to important customer-outcome variables. In this article, we identify dimensions of customer-based corporate reputation and develop scales to measure these dimensions (Study 1). Based on comprehensive validation procedures across three service firm types, we found support for a five-dimensional scale with the following dimensions: Customer Orientation, Good Employer, Reliable and Financially Strong Company, Product and Service Quality, and Social and Environmental Responsibility. In Study 2, using a second sample, we validate our scale and examine its relationship with important customer-outcome variables-customer satisfaction, loyalty, trust, and word of mouth. Most of the reputation dimensions were strongly associated with important outcome variables, with a few exceptions. We discuss the results with reference to the marketing implications.

TI Customer switching resistance (CSR) - The effects of perceived equity,
   trust and relationship commitment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICE INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - This research attempts to understand why - or why not - customers resist switching service providers when a critical incident occurs. The paper examines how service relationship perceptions, such as perceived equity, trust (perceived reliability and benevolence) and relationship commitment (affective and calculative), enhance relationship maintenance and CSR in many critical situations.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted in the financial service industry on a sample of 1,999 consumers (retail banking) and then conceptualized and measured CSR in several critical situations.
   Findings - The paper demonstrates that perceived equity, perceived reliability, perceived benevolence, affective commitment, and calculative commitment do not influence CSR the same way. CSR mainly depends on the type of critical incident which occurs. For instance, calculative commitment, which is an evaluation of the costs associated with leaving the service provider, enhances CSR in three critical situations (service encounter failures, employee responses to service failures, pricing problems), whereas it leads to relationship disengagement in two other critical situations (inconvenience, changes in the consumer or service provider situation).
   Research limitations/implications - This research highlights the need to better take into account the different types of critical incident discussed in the relationship marketing literature and to better consider the complementary roles of perceived equity, trust and relationship commitment in the service switching literature.
   Originality/value - This research implies that service companies have to anticipate the critical incidents and to develop specific "shock absorbers" to continue doing business with their current customers.

AB Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs are increasingly popular corporate marketing strategies. This paper argues that CSR programs can fall along a continuum between two endpoints: Institutionalized programs and Promotional programs. This classification is based on an exploratory study examining the variance of four responses from the consumer stakeholder group toward these two categories of CSR. Institutionalized CSR programs are argued to be most effective at increasing customer loyalty, enhancing attitude toward the company, and decreasing consumer skepticism. Promotional CSR programs are argued to be more effective at generating purchase intent. Ethical and managerial implications of these preliminary findings are discussed.

TI Intangible economy: how can investors deliver change in businesses?
   Lessons from nonprofit-business partnerships
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to investigate the following issues. Investors traditionally prioritised tangible outcomes (money, land, machinery) in order to protect their financial assets. However, the intangible economy (trust, human resources, information, reputation) that co-exists draws attention to new expectations that request the continuous, active and within the public sphere involvement of investors in order to protect their assets by prioritising intangible resources.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper the case of non-profit-business partnerships is employed in order to demonstrate how change can be achieved.
   Findings - The paper finds that investors in intangible outcomes who aim to achieve change in corporations share the same limitations within the financial and non-financial field.
   Originality/value - The paper highlights investment in the intangible economy as a mechanism of co-determining the priority of responsibilities in the context of corporate social responsibility. The role of investors is crucial in facilitating the shift from the tangible to the intangible economy.

It is based on integrating two traditionally distinct approaches to CSR: one views it as compatible with economic objectives, while the other regards it as incompatible with them. By bringing these two approaches together and recognizing CSR's multiple functions, this article analyzes how CSR can offer a crucial advantage to managers by providing a means of insuring financial performance against negative events. This latent insurance value is often ignored in traditional evaluations of the relationship between CSR and financial performance.

TI Corporate social responsibility and resource-based perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Firms engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) because they consider that some kind of competitive advantage accrues to them. We contend that resource-based perspectives (RBP) are useful to understand why firms engage in CSR activities and disclosure. From a resource-based perspective CSR is seen as providing internal or external benefits, or both. Investments in socially responsible activities may have internal benefits by helping a firm to develop new resources and capabilities which are related namely to know-how and corporate culture. In effect, investing in social responsibility activities and disclosure has important consequences on the creation or depletion of fundamental intangible resources, namely those associated with employees. The external benefits of CSR are related to its effect on corporate reputation. Corporate reputation can be understood as a fundamental intangible resource which can be created or depleted as a consequence of the decisions to engage or not in social responsibility activities and disclosure. Firms with good social responsibility reputation may improve relations with external actors. They may also attract better employees or increase current employees' motivation, morale, commitment and loyalty to the firm. This article contributes to the understanding of why CSR may be seen as having strategic value for firms and how RBP can be used in such endeavour.

TI Analysis of social performance in the Spanish financial industry through
   public data. A proposal
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Banking firms are becoming increasingly aware that their clients' management of environmental and social risks may in term threaten their own business as lenders and investors. In addition, stakeholders are requiring banks to improve their social performance. As a result, some banks are developing corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and management systems to reduce potential risks and improve their performance. In the Spanish financial system, half of the banking firms are savings banks, most of which have always used some Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria in their management. Private Banks have only recently started to integrate social aspects in their performance. However, no formal analysis has been carried out on the impact of CSR strategies. Various initiatives have been launched nationally and internationally to include the social dimension in management systems. The purpose of this research is to analyse the social performance of the main Spanish financial companies through public data such as social or sustainability reports and media sources. In order to do this, we need to determine which CSR criteria most greatly affect banking firms and to choose the most accurate quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure social performance.

CT Interdisciplinary Corporate Social Responsibility Research Conference
CY OCT, 2004
CL Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, ENGLAND
HO Univ Nottingham
AB We use transformational leadership theory to explore the role of CEOs in determining the extent to which their firms engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR). We test this theory using data from 56 US and Canadian firms. CEO intellectual stimulation (but not CEO charismatic leadership) is found to be significantly associated with the propensity of the firm to engage in 'strategic' CSR, or those CSR activities that are most likely to be related to the firm's corporate and business-level strategies. Thus, studies that ignore the role of leadership in CSR may yield imprecise conclusions regarding the antecedents and consequences of these activities. We also critique transformational leadership theory, in terms of its overemphasis on charismatic forms of leadership. This leads to a reconceptualization of transformational leadership, which emphasizes the intellectual stimulation component in the context of CSR.

TI The cost implications of waste reduction: factor demand, competitiveness
   and policy implications
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS
AB Manufacturing produces both good and "bad" outputs, such as waste, which have negative environmental effects. Economic (e.g., tax) and non-economic (e.g., reputation) incentives encourage firms to reduce waste. However, such practices are costly because decreases in output produced or increases in inputs used may accompany waste reduction. We employ a cost function approach to evaluate patterns of output and waste production and capital, labor, and materials use, for UK manufacturing plants. We find that costs of waste reduction generally imply increasing materials use and capital and labor input saving, but vary by county, region, and industry.

AB Little is known about the impact of family ownership and management on corporate social performance. Some scholars have suggested that family firms are not likely to act in a socially responsible manner, while others have indicated that socially responsible behavior on the part of the family firm protects the family's assets. This preliminary study compares the degree to which family and nonfamily firms are socially responsible using data from 1991 to 2000 from the S&P 500. Two hundred sixty-one firms (202 nonfamily and 59 family) appeared in the S&P 500 for the 10-year period. Findings show that family firms are more socially responsible than nonfamily firms along several dimensions. This is likely due to family concern about image and reputation and a desire to protect family assets.

TI Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social
   responsibility and financial performance
SO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB A central and contentious debate in many literatures concerns the relationship between financial and social performance. We advance this debate by measuring the financial-social performance link within mutual funds that practice socially responsible investing (SRI). SRI fund managers have an array of social screening strategies from which to choose. Prior studies have not addressed this heterogeneity within SRI funds. Combining modern portfolio and stakeholder theories, we hypothesize that the financial loss borne by an SRI fund due to poor diversification is offset as social screening intensifies because better-managed and more stable firms are selected into its portfolio. We find support for this hypothesis through an empirical test on a panel of 61 SRI funds from 1972 to 2000. The results show that as the number of social screens used by an SRI fund increases, financial returns decline at first, but then rebound as the number of screens reaches a maximum. That is, we find a curvilinear relationship, suggesting that two long-competing viewpoints may be complementary. Furthermore, we find that financial performance varies with the types of social screens used. Community relations screening increased financial performance, but environmental and labor relations screening decreased financial performance. Based on our results, we suggest that literatures addressing the link between financial and social performance move toward in-depth examination of the merits of different social screening strategies, and away from the continuing debate on the financial merits of either being socially responsible or not.

TI Executive compensation in socially responsible firms
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
AB This study examines chief executive officer (CEO) compensation and turnover in socially responsible (SR) firms. We compare characteristics of SR firms with a matched sample of firms based on industry and size. Analysis of CEO compensation indicates that the link between CEO pay and firm performance is weaker for SR firms than for non-SR firms. CEO turnover tests indicate that SR firms are more likely to experience CEO turnover following poor performance. Stock option grants to CEOs of SR firms do not appear to result in future risk-taking behaviour, whereas such grants are significantly related to future risk at non-SR firms.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This article explores the nature of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate reputation using qualitative research approach. Specifically, the relationship between CSR and corporate reputation is examined from the viewpoint of value theory. This paper brings up for discussion the various value priorities lying in the background of CSR actions. The aim is to form categories of value priorities around CSR and reputation, based on qualitative research approach. The main concepts in this paper - CSR, reputation and value - are also defined. This paper further discusses the theory of value structure and content, which identifies certain principal values among different cultures. The data consist of eight interviews with employees of a newspaper company. The results suggest that value priorities play an influential role in CSR actions, influencing to the essence of certain reputation stories in the corporate context.

The two studies show that high-fit sponsorship programs between nonprofit service firms and businesses positively influence brand identity via broad associations and brand meaning, brand response, and brand relationships through specific associations. Conversely, low-fit sponsorship programs are likely to hinder nonprofit brand management strategies by negatively affecting brand identity, brand meaning, brand response, and brand relationships. Finally, the results reveal that nonprofit service organizations can use supportive communications to counter the risks a strategic alliances with low-fit businesses.

TI Risks to reputation: A global approach
SO GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB Reputation is an intangible asset that directly affects the market value of the firm. Although reputation evidences belief that the firm is on a sustainable course, it is built on the trust established with all stakeholders through past proper behaviour. It proves more resilient than one might think at first but even menial misconducts, if repeated, can lead to a downfall. The demise of a few can engulf a whole industry when the transactions are based on trust in the fulfilment of future promises. This is why reputation has become an object of research for several branches of management sciences. The key drivers are still in need of refinement. Nevertheless, they can be summarized in one word: authenticity.

TI Reputation management in the Japanese insurance marketplace
SO GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB As seen in many other parts of the globe, there is a growing public awareness of corporate ethics in Japan. The deregulation process in the Japanese insurance marketplace is causing a shift toward a market in which a customer's choice becomes the defining factor in a carrier selection. The reputation of the carrier plays a critical role in this selection. The author believes that the origin of reputation management evolves from a business conduct stemming from gaining each customer's trust. One of the initiatives that is currently in force on a company-specific basis is to "expand the scope and activities of insurance,'' to enrich the function of insurance products beyond its traditional concept. The hope is that this initiative will contribute to society's growth, which will ultimately enhance the company's positive reputation. Meanwhile, there is an ongoing effort to design a quantitative analysis methodology to enable a truly functional model of reputation management.

TI Some thoughts on reputation and challenges for global financial
   institutions
SO GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB Reputation is an amorphous concept. It is intangible. It can change over time ( for better or worse). It is difficult to define. It is difficult to measure. It is difficult, if not impossible, to value ( and is assigned no value by our accounting conventions). And yet it is, without question, among the most valuable assets of any company, particularly a global financial institution. ... But what exactly is "reputation'' in this context? In my view, "reputation'' is a multi-faceted concept derived from many different individual components. A company's reputation, however, is a blended perception that transcends its individual component parts. For a financial institution, these component parts are multiple and include: financial performance and strength, client trust and confidence, client service, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance practices, corporate ethics, corporate disclosure practices, as well as relations with regulatory authorities and compliance in a broad sense.

TI Conditioning effect of prior reputation on perception of corporate
   giving
SO PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
AB Prior corporate reputation, one responsibility of a public relations department, affects public perceptions toward corporate philanthropic messages and ultimately affects public attitudes toward the company. Using an experiment that emulates the sort of news consumption individuals normally undertake, participants inferred corporate charitable giving as a mutually beneficial activity when a company had a good reputation (H I a). Participants inferred corporate charitable giving as a self-interested activity when the company had a bad reputation (H1b). Also, public inference (suspicion) successfully mediated corporate prior reputation on public attitude toward the company (112). Participants showed positive attitude toward the company when they inferred the company had an altruistic motive for charitable giving (H3a). However, participants showed negative attitude toward the company when they inferred the company had a self-interested motive for charitable giving (H3b). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Eliminating child labour in Malawi: a British American Tobacco corporate
   responsibility project to sidestep tobacco labour exploitation
SO TOBACCO CONTROL
AB Objectives: To examine British American Tobacco and other tobacco industry support of the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation.
   Design: Analyses of internal tobacco industry documents and ethnographic data.
   Results: British American Tobacco co-founded the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation (ECLT) in October 2000 and launched its pilot project in Malawi. ECLT's initial projects were budgeted at US$2.3 million over four years. Labour unions and leaf dealers, through ECLT funds, have undertook modest efforts such as building schools, planting trees, and constructing shallow wells to address the use of child labour in tobacco farming. In stark contrast, the tobacco companies receive nearly US$40 million over four years in economic benefit through the use of unpaid child labour in Malawi during the same time. BAT's efforts to combat child labour in Malawi through ECLT was developed to support the company's ''corporate social responsibility agenda'' rather than accepting responsibility for taking meaningful steps to eradicate child labour in the Malawi tobacco sector.
   Conclusion: In Malawi, transnational tobacco companies are using child labour projects to enhance corporate reputations and distract public attention from how they profit from low wages and cheap tobacco.

TI Reexamining the expected effect of available resources and firm size on
   firm environmental orientation: An empirical study of UK firms
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB An emergent body of literature examined why some firms apply some environmental initiatives while other firms do not take responsibility for their natural environment? Thus, firm environmental orientation (responsiveness and performance) are linked in the literature to several variables. Unfortunately, the relationship between firm environmental orientation and either available resources or firm size showed mixed results and inconclusive evidence. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show empirically how available resources and firm size can explain differences in firm environmental responsiveness and environmental performance. Econometric results of environmental responsiveness using the logistic regression model demonstrated that firm size does appear to add something unique in explaining differences in environmental responsiveness while available resource can be safely dropped from the model. However, econometric analysis of environmental performance using the maximum-likelihood random effects model showed strong evidence that available resources and firm size are significant predictors of firm environmental performance.

TI Corporate reputation and social performance: The importance of fit
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB Utilizing data on a sample of large firms, we estimate a model of corporate reputation. We find reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market analysts, to be determined by a firm's social performance, financial performance, market risk, the extent of long-term institutional ownership, and the nature of its business activities. Furthermore, the reputational effect of social performance is found to vary both across sectors, and within sectors across the various types of social performance. Specifically, our results demonstrate the need to achieve a 'fit' among the types of corporate social performance undertaken and the firm's stakeholder environment. For example, a strong record of environmental performance may enhance or damage reputation depending on whether the firm's activities 'fit' with environmental concerns in the eyes of stakeholders.

AB Firms and industries increasingly subscribe to voluntary codes of conduct. These self-regulatory governance systems can be effective in establishing a more sustainable and inclusive global economy. However, these codes can also be largely symbolic, reactive measures to quell public criticism. Cross-sector alliances (between for-profit and nonprofit actors) present a learning platform for infusing participants with greater incentives to be socially responsible. They can provide multinationals new capabilities that allow them to more closely ally social responsibility with economic performance. This paper examines learning facilitators in cross-sector alliances that enrich corporate understanding of stakeholder concerns. it suggests that these organizational learning experiments can translate into globally responsible practices and processes that improve the content and effectiveness of voluntary corporate codes.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is often used as a key criterion in gauging corporate reputation. This research examined the influence of consumers' attributions on corporate outcomes in response to CSR. Researchers and managers have considered consumers' beliefs about CSR initiatives to be simplistic, serving either economic ends or reflecting sincere social concerns. The results of two studies established that consumers' attributions were more complex than traditionally viewed, mirroring many of the motives ascribed to companies by managers and researchers. Rather than viewing corporate efforts along a self- or other-centered continuum, consumers differentiated four types of motives: self-centered motives that are strategic and egoistic and other-centered motives that are values driven and stakeholder driven. Consumers responded most positively to CSR efforts they judged as values driven mid strategic while responding negatively to efforts perceived as stakeholder driven or egoistic. Attributions were shown to affect purchase intent as well as mediate the structure of an offer.

TI The financial performance of a socially responsible investment over time
   and a possible link with corporate social responsibility
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper empirically examines the financial performance of a UK unit trust that was initially "conventional" and later adopted socially responsible investment (SRI) principles (ethical investment principles). Comparison is made with three similar conventional funds whose investment objectives remained unchanged. Analysis techniques employed in previous studies find similar results: mean risk-adjusted performance is unchanged by the switch to SRI, with no evidence of over-or under-performance relative to the benchmark market index by any of the four funds. More interestingly, changes in variability of returns over time are also modelled using generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models, not previously applied to SRI funds so far as is known. Results show a temporary increase in variability of returns, followed by a return to previous levels after around 4 years. Evidence shows the increased variability to be associated with the adoption of SRI rather than with a change in fund management. Possible explanations for the subsequent reduction in variability include the spread of corporate social responsibility activities by firms and learning by fund managers. In addition to reporting on a previously unobserved phenomenon, this paper raises questions for further research.

AB Based on theories of attribution and suspicion, three experiments highlight the mediating role of perceived sincerity of motives in determining the effectiveness of CSR activities. CSR activities improve a company's image when consumers attribute sincere motives, are ineffective when sincerity of motives is ambiguous, and hurt the company's image when motives are perceived as insincere. Variables affecting perceived sincerity include the benefit salience of the cause, the source through which consumers learn about CSR, and the ratio of CSR contributions and CSR-related advertising. High benefit salience of the cause hurts the company, in particular when consumers learn about it from a company source. This backfire effect can be overcome by spending more on CSR activities than on advertising that features CSR.

TI Corporate social responsibility: Three key approaches
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB Corporate social responsibility remains an embryonic and contestable concept. This paper assesses three key approaches and offers a perspective gauging little prospect of theoretical synthesis. Ethical responsibility theory advocates strong corporate self-restraint and altruism duties and expansive public policy strengthening stakeholder rights. Economic responsibility theory advocates market wealth creation subject only to minimalist public policy and perhaps customary business ethics. These two viewpoints embed competing moral frameworks and political philosophies. Any theoretical synthesis must discover some subset of ethical principles yielding corporate competitive advantage. Corporate citizenship language invokes a political metaphor providing neither true intermediate positioning nor theoretical synthesis. Two conflicting interpretations abandon responsibility language without adopting the economic viewpoint. An instrumental citizenship interpretation expands philanthropy as a strategic lever for increasing corporate reputation and market opportunities while retaining managerial discretion. An ideal citizenship interpretation restates ethical responsibility into voluntarism language intended to influence managerial discretion concerning universal human rights.

TI Why should they care? The role of institutional investors in the market
   for corporate global responsibility
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
AB Institutional investors, primarily pension funds, drive global financial markets. The result is investors vulnerable to the risks companies face in global consumer and capital markets. Though some market risks are inevitable, others, such as reputation risk, can be mitigated through increased corporate social and environmental standards and the increased transparency that such higher standards demand. The transparency necessitated by reputation management has a dual role in monitoring corporate behaviour and providing all stakeholders (internal and external) with the information to evaluate corporate behaviour. Driving this process is the belief that higher standards of corporate responsibility pay off for investors over the long term both through potential equity premia and through risk reduction. This paper presents a model for understanding how and why institutional investors may encourage firms to adopt higher standards. To illustrate our argument, we refer to the experience of the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) strategy of corporate engagement and the attempts of the USS to encourage firms to raise their environmental standards by focusing on the climate change impacts of pension-fund investments. Investor engagement in corporate responsibility offers an insight into the role of investors in global-standard setting and global citizenship.

TI Imperializing spin cycles: A postcolonial look at public relations,
   greenwashing, and the separation of publics
SO PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
AB This article draws on postcolonial theory to critique ongoing neocolonial aspects of public relations theory and practice and especially the field's recent appropriation of terms such as "corporate social responsibility" and "sustainable development." It positions such appropriation as a continuation of the old colonial strategy of reputation management among elite publics at the expense of marginalized publics. The article makes the case that public relations can only begin to be ethical and socially responsible if it acknowledges the diversity of publics, breaks down the hierarchy of publics, and takes into account the resistance of peripheral publics.

TI The relationship between corporate philanthropy and shareholder wealth:

SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB I present a complex theoretical explanation that draws on multiple bodies of literature to present an academically rigorous version of a simple argument: good deeds earn chits. I advance/defend three core assertions: (1) corporate philanthropy can generate positive moral capital among communities and stakeholders, (2) moral capital can provide shareholders with insurance-like protection for a firm's relationship-based intangible assets. and (3) this protection contributes to shareholder wealth. I highlight several managerial implications of these core assertions.

TI Effects of an employee volunteering program on the work force: The
   ABN-AMRO case
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB One of the new ways used by companies to demonstrate their social responsibility is to encourage employee volunteering, whereby employees engage in socially beneficial activities on company time, while being paid by the company. The reasoning is that it is good for employee motivation (internal effects) and good for the company reputation (external effects). This article reports an empirical investigation of the internal effects of employee volunteering conducted amongst employees of the Dutch ABN-AMRO bank. The study showed that (a) socio-demographic characteristics from employee volunteers markedly differ from those of non-volunteers and community volunteers and (b) employee volunteering seems to have positive effects on attitudes and behavior towards the organization.

TI Corporate reputation: What do consumers really care about?
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH
AB Do consumers really care about corporate reputation when it comes to purchasing decisions? This study tests that hypothesis by comparing consumers' perceptions of companies to the consumer equity of brands owned by those companies, using international studies of brand equity and corporate reputation. The results show that poor corporate reputation makes building strong brands difficult, but a good reputation is no guarantee of success.
   The elements of corporate reputation that seem to matter most to consumers in practice are perceptions of fairness toward consumers, and perceptions of corporate success and leadership, rather than public responsibility. Consumers want good business practice but when it comes to brand strength and purchasing, more personally relevant factors take precedence. So pushing a corporate social responsibility agenda to consumers may not reap the strongest rewards. But "ethical" brands that bring no penalty in cost or quality are likely to be more successful.

TI Corporate reputation and philanthropy: An empirical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper analyzes the determinants of corporate reputation within a sample of large UK companies drawn from a diverse range of industries. We pay particular attention to the role that philanthropic expenditures and policies may play in shaping the perceptions of companies among their, stakeholders. Our findings highlight that companies which make higher levels of philanthropic expenditures have better reputations and that this eect varies significantly across industries. Given that reputational indices tend to reflect the financial performance of organizations above other factors (Fryxell, G. E. and J. Wang: 1994, journal of Management 20, 1-14) and that elements of the literature emphasise that discretionary aspects of social responsibility, including corporate donations, may not be in the financial interests of organizations (e.g. Friedman, M.: 1970, "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits", New York Times Magazine, September 13), this is a significant finding. It suggests that philanthropic expenditures may play a significant role in stakeholder management and may, in particular, lead to stakeholders holding more positive impressions of philanthropic corporations.

TI A team production model of corporate governance
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE
AB A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance.
   Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers) who bring the firm's know-how to the table.
   The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance.

Using real options theory, I develop the notion of corporate social responsibility as a real option and its implications for risk management.

TI Competing responsibly
SO BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY
AB In this paper we examine the effects of different competitive conditions on the determination and evaluation of strategies of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Although the mainstream of current thinking in business ethics recognizes that a firm should invest in social responsibility, the normative theory on how specific competitive conditions affect a firm's social responsibility remains underdeveloped. Intensity of competition, risks to reputation and the regulatory environment determine the competitive conditions of a firm. Our central thesis is that differential strength of competition produces differential moral legitimacy of firm behavior. When competition is fierce or weak, different acts or strategies become morally acceptable, as well as economically rational. A firm has to develop its own strategy of social responsibility, in light of its competitive position, as well as ethical considerations.

TI Breaking and re-entering: British American tobacco in China 1979-2000
SO TOBACCO CONTROL
AB Objectives: To analyse the strategy used by British American Tobacco (BAT) to re-enter the Chinese market from 1979 to 2000 after historically dominating the market before the 1950s.
   Design: Analysis of tobacco industry document files to date available only on-site at the Guildford Depository operated by BAT. An additional search of recent documents related to BAT, placed in the Minnesota Depository, was also carried out.
   Results: BAT has been committed to regaining its historically dominant position in China since the country reopened to foreign companies in 1979. Initially, BAT remained cautious relative to competitors in seeking joint ventures, finding market access hindered by bureaucratic complexity, restrictions on foreign investment and imports quotas, and later an advertising ban. Instead, the documents suggest BAT strongly relied on illegal imports to expand market presence of State Express 555 and other key brands. It was only when risks to contraband sales increased that the company made greater efforts to establish a legal presence in the country. Attempts to stress the long history of BAT in China and a proclaimed commitment to corporate social responsibility have been used to facilitate later negotiations.
   Conclusion: China has remained relatively closed to transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) during its transition to a market economy, maintaining a firm grip over foreign investment and imports. Nonetheless, BAT has circumvented such restrictions through illegal imports and exploitation of inconsistencies in the local enforcement of advertising bans. Governments need to understand and address the full range of market entry tactics by TTCs in order to ensure effective tobacco control.

TI Shareholder activism on environmental issues: A study of proposals at
   large US corporations (2000-2003)
SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) has carved out a niche in the financial world, and each year a large number of shareholder proposals are filed at public companies in the US related to issues of corporate social responsibility (CSR). While the primary interests of CSR activists remain distinct from those of traditional corporate governance (CG) activists, the two groups do share an interest in minimizing the risk of negative environmental or social impacts from the operations of the corporation. They also share the objective of achieving transparency and accountability in corporate decision-making. In relation to this latter objective, they both face similar challenges concerning conflicts of interest among key institutional shareholders. This article examines the record of shareholder proposal filing and voting from 2000-2003 for 81 large US public corporations to determine the relative prominence of CSR shareholder activism and the prospects for effective CSR shareholder activism on key environmental issues. The analysis of these data finds that nearly half (45%) of all shareholder resolutions are related to CSR, and that those resolutions which combine issues of CSR with traditional CG activism appeal to slightly more shareholders than issues of CSR alone. The article also examines shareholder activism at the micro level with a case study of the voting record at ExxonMobil. The article finds that CSR-related shareholder activism represents the majority of shareholder activism within that firm and that resolutions targeted at climate change are particularly well supported. These resolutions draw a connection between environmental risk and risk to shareholder value. While numerous challenges remain for both CG and CSR activists, the article concludes that reforms that strengthen shareholder rights and corporate governance more generally will also benefit CSR activists and the environmental policies they promote in particular. The article ends with some proposed solutions for addressing the perceived conflicts of interest in corporate governance and the shareholder voting process.

TI The end of managerial ideology: From corporate social responsibility to
   corporate social indifference
SO ENTERPRISE & SOCIETY
AB During the 1990s, U.S. managerial capitalism underwent a profound transformation from a technocratic to a "proprietary" form. In the technocratic era, managers had functioned as teams to sustain the firm and to promote social welfare by satisfying the demands of competing stakeholders. In the new proprietary era, corporate bureaucratic teams broke up into tournaments in which managers competed for advancement toward the CEO prize. The reward system of the new era depended heavily on stock options that were accompanied by downside risk protection. The tournaments turned managers into a special class of shareholders who sought to maximize their individual utility functions even if deviating from the firm's best interest. Once this new regime became established, managers discarded their technocratic, stakeholder creed and adopted a property rights ideology, originally elaborated in academia by financial agency theorists. Managers hardly noticed (or cared) they were capturing a disproportionate share of the new wealth being generated in the U.S. economy. When critics brought this fact to light, managers replied like well-schooled economists: markets worked efficiently. Whether they worked fairly was a question they did not address.

TI Corporate citizenship: How to strengthen the social responsibility of
   managers?
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Corporate citizenship challenges the foundations and working of the basic institutions market, state and civil society. These institutional changes complicate the work of the manager, because the responsibilities of management are not only increasing, they are also becoming vaguer and more elusive. In this paper, I will analyze the new, complex responsibilities of management in terms of the scope and the legitimization of corporate citizenship. What may we expect of individual organizations? Which wishes of which stakeholders should be honored? How can we legitimize the new societal and public role of business firms? The outcome of this analysis will be translated to the practice of management; how can we strengthen the social responsibility of managers? Four options will be discussed. (1) Market regulation, which binds the actions of managers. (2) Professionalization of management, which seeks for better information. (3) Moral management, which incorporates norms and values from outside the market. (4) Stakeholder management, which leaves room for the participation of stakeholders. These options can be schematized according to an internal-external axis and an objective-subjective axis. I will show that stakeholder management fits the best with the idea of corporate citizenship, but has serious risks of failing.

Based on 37 indicators (composed out of 54 questions) it was found that Greek companies demonstrate a fairly satisfactory degree of compliance with OECD guidelines. Their weak points lie in: the role of stakeholders and corporate social responsibility; the organisation of CG; the effective role of the independent members of the board (which may be attributed to the small size of the pool of potential independent board members); disclosure of remuneration; and risk management. Methodologically, the merit of the exercise lies in its approach towards the creation of "collectively subjective" weightings, an effort to discuss the benefits of separating the rating of the market from the rating of companies and the discussion on typologies of work that can be effectively performed through rating exercises.

TI Consumer perception of corporate donations - Effects of company
   reputation for social responsibility and type of donation
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In cause-related marketing (CRM), a company agrees to donate money to a charity each time a consumer engages in a revenue-producing transaction with the firm. Since the company benefits first before any obligation to donate is accrued, consumers might perceive this practice to be less altruistic than an unconditional donation to a cause. If so, CRM could backfire, injuring corporate image. This study investigated the effects of type of donation (conditional or not conditional upon corporate revenue) and reputation of the firm making the donation (firms described as scrupulous, average, or irresponsible in the discharge of their social responsibility) on consumer regard for the firm; perceived mercenary intent of the firm; and whether the social performance of the company is consistent with "good" management. Consumer responses were predicted based on the contrast effect and attribution theory. Results suggest that irresponsible firms increased their favor with consumers by pursuing either type of donation. The average firm enhanced its image by pursuing an unconditional donation, but a conditional donation did not damage firm image. Perception of the scrupulous firm was little changed after unconditional donation, but a scrupulous firm suffered a loss of favor by pursuing CRM. It is concluded that the average firm does not risk a loss of public goodwill when using CRM.

TI Management decision-making - an ethical perspective
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER
AB Engineering organisations can improve their management decisions in the competitive global arena of today, especially for the long term. The main issue is to take into account not only economic metrics but also technological, environmental and ethical challenges. This can be achieved by corporate social responsibility in the work-place as well as being involved with, and accountable to, stakeholders. Increasingly, this seems to be the way forward as it is vital for companies and society to coexist. In this paper guidelines and criteria are explored to relate the ethical dimension to performance management in order to create inclusive value. There is a definite synergy between business excellence and good ethical practice, where the latter becomes a fundamental purpose rather than just an add-on. This is because such an approach contributes to an organisation's reputation which, thereupon, can be trusted and sustained. Thus, a performance-focused management system, in an engineering scenario, is the best vehicle for institutionalising targeted goals and galvanising action founded on high ethical standards.

TI Public independent fact-finding: A trust-generating institution for an
   age of corporate illegitimacy and public mistrust
SO VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW
AB Public distrust in the wake of corporate scandals caused corporate legitimacy crises for the companies involved and for the marketplace as a whole. The loss of trust has contributed to an environment in which traditional responses to allegations of wrongdoing and incompetence are less effective. Alternatively, organizations engage in "Public independent fact-finding" ("PIFF") by hiring public figures with reputations for integrity to conduct internal investigations and to report their findings to the public. This Article describes the role played by trust, reputation, and social legitimacy in the health of organizations and examines corporate legitimacy crises and traditional responses. Identifying factors that undermine the effectiveness of apologia and other trust-generating institutions, it explores PIFF as an alternative process and considers the benefits and inherent problems of attempting to institutionalize the process better. Focusing on lawyers as fact finders and the American Arbitration Association's new Independent Fact-Finding Service, it analyzes the procedural and ethical issues associated with possible institutionalization models. The authors assert that procedures should ensure the integrity of the process. Ultimately, the public trust in individuals and entities and in the processes in which they engage is a precious commodity for institutions in crises. In turn, their reputations are a public good. Such fact finders are essentially "trustees" with corresponding fiduciary duties, and it is essential to conduct these processes to preserve the public's confidence. Although not a panacea, the PIFF concept may provide a quick, fair, and objective intervention to resolve controversy based on rumor and innuendo. In a global society in which public opinion changes rapidly, fact-finding fills a void in dispute-handling processes between the formal application of law and the informal shaping of public opinion.

TI Corporate social and financial performance: A meta-analysis
SO ORGANIZATION STUDIES
AB Most theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions. With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP-CFP relationship than is currently assumed to exist by many business scholars.

TI Corporate ethics as a factor for success - the measurement instrument of
   the University of Agricultural Sciences (BOKU), Vienna
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Over the past decade, a growing number of companies have recognized the business benefits of corporate social responsibilities policies and practices. Their experiences are bolstered by a growing body of empirical studies which demonstrate that corporate social responsibility (CSR) has a positive impact on business economic performance, and is not harmful to shareholder value. There are six key responsibilities or dimensions of CSR and CSR is really how to manage these six responsibilities. Companies employing such a new values-based business approach have found that it can improve financial performance, increase employees' motivation and commitment to work, and enhance customer loyalty and corporate reputation. The model in use (theoretical language), is able to explain the impact of CSR with the help of a bundle of dependent variables. Measuring CSR also affects additional benefits. The "BOKU approach" defines the independent variables (objective language) for the CSR working model and shows the way to measure (correspondential language) the independent variables by auditing using a "reduced design", Austriacism and a "mystery" shift to enhance the acceptance rate.

TI "I didn't know" and "I was only doing my job": Has corporate governance
   careened out of control? A case study of Enron's information myopia
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper discusses internal dynamics of the firm that contribute to the failure of knowledge conditions, using the Enron scandal as a case study. Ability of the board to effectively monitor conduct at operational levels includes various dynamics: senior management being isolated from those at operational levels; individuals pursuing subgoals that are contrary to overall corporate goals; information flow along a narrow linear channel that effectively forecloses adverse information from getting to senior management; a corporate culture of intimidation, discouraging open expressions of doubt or skepticism, resulting in reluctance to challenge senior officials, and pushing the limits of ethics and the law.
   Elements of information blockage in the corporation include: the "law of diminishing control"; deliberate concealment of information by officers; motivation to report to the boss what one perceives the boss wants to hear; theory of "bounded rationality" that explains surprising role of irrationality in decisionmaking-unconscious emotions and motivations. Discussion of behavioralist studies of cognitive dissonance, belief perseverance, confirmatory bias, entity effect, motivated reasoning, group cohesion or "groupthink," and the false consensus effect. Problem of overoptimism-tendency of many people to overrate their own abilities, contributions and talents-and tendency toward puffery and dismissal of risks in formulating disclosures and press releases.
   Imposing liability on directors for failure of oversight is extremely difficult to sustain in a court of law. Directors are likely to face much greater demands of accountability in the wake of Enron. Solutions to enhance flow of information include programs to encourage employees to expose wrongdoing without fear of retribution; devising of communication system that enables important information to move upward to the proper decisionmaker without getting distorted; restructuring of audit committees, providing adequate training for new directors, expanding the number of independent directors on the board. In the wake of Enron, corporations may simply have no choice but to meet increased demands by workers, shareholders, customers and the government for greater accountability.
   Appendix to paper discusses the history of the corporation, moral dilemmas of the shareholder-centric model, and whether important social goods sometimes trump the notion of profit-maximization.

TI Mining, corporate social responsibility and the "community": The case of
   Rio Tinto, Richards Bay minerals and the Mbonambi
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Mining companies have long had a questionable reputation for social responsibility, especially in developing countries. In recent years, mining companies operating in developing countries have come under increased pressure as opponents have placed them under greater public scrutiny. Mining companies have responded by developing global corporate social responsibility strategies as part of their larger global business strategies. In these strategies, a prominent place is given to their relationship with local communities. For business ethics, one basic issue is whether such an approach to corporate responsibility is likely to effectively address the development concerns of local communities in developing countries. This paper addresses this question by investigating how the corporate social responsibility agenda of a major minor company has been implemented by one of its subsidiaries in South Africa.

AB This paper argues that multinational corporations face levels of environmental and social responsibility higher than their national counterparts. Drawing on the literatures of stakeholder salience, corporate reputation management, and evidence from the confrontation between Shell and Greenpeace over the Brent Spar, in 1995, two mechanisms - international reputation side effects, and foreign stakeholder salience - are identified and their contribution in creating an environment more restrictive, in terms of environmental and social responsibility, is elaborated on. The paper concludes with discussing the links of the work presented here with a number of ongoing debates within the filed of international business ethics, and the managerial implications of the two mechanisms identified.

TI The ethicality of altruistic corporate social responsibility
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING
AB This commentary questions commonly held assumptions about corporate social responsibility (CSR). It discusses the morality of altruistic CSR - philanthropic CSR activities that are not necessarily beneficial to the firm's financial position. Evaluating altruistic CSR from all major ethical perspectives - utilitarianism, rights, justice and care - leads to the conclusion that, for public-IN, held corporations, such activity is immoral. This is because altruistic CSR violates shareholder property rights, unjustly seizing stockholder wealth, and it bestows benefits for the general welfare at the expense of those for whom the firm should care in close relationships. The paper also determines that what are often considered mandatory ethical and social corporate duties are actually optional activities that should only be undertaken when it appears that they can enhance the value of the firm, i.e. when they are used as strategic CSR. However, using ideas taken from secular and Judaeo-Christian authors on the meaning of work, the article also concludes that altruistic activities are appropriate and commendable for private firms and individuals. It offers suggestions for practitioners of CSR and for future academic research.

TI Global finance and the German model: German corporations, market
   incentives, and the management of employer-sponsored pension
   institutions
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
AB Where there was a settled political geography of state power and responsibilities, the remarkable growth of global finance has put enormous pressure on national economic, political and social institutions. Furthermore, the looming crisis facing many continental European social security systems has raised many doubts about the long-term viability of the German model compared to its Anglo-American rivals. In this context, large German corporations have sought ways of sustaining their global competitiveness by, in part, restructuring their national and regional commitments. To illustrate, in this paper we concentrate on the nature and organization of German employer-sponsored pension institutions in relation to Anglo-American management practice. Two issues drive the analysis. One has to do with an emerging coalition between corporate management and shareholders with respect to the market value of the firm. The second issue has to do with the allocation of risk and uncertainty between the social partners when negotiating the financing and final value of promised retirement income. The institutional framework of collective decision-making common to many of Germany's largest firms is under pressure; three models of investment decision making relevant to pension assets and liabilities are used to illustrate this point. In doing so, we suggest that the German model is more fragile than commonly realized. We also suggest that Anglo-American management practices have penetrated and affected German corporate (national and regional) institutions and regulations. The social market lauded by advocates of stakeholder capitalism is changing rapidly, at least in the sphere of large firms and global finance.

TI Corporate social responsibility and financial disclosures: An
   alternative explanation for increased disclosure
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Researchers and practitioners have devoted considerable attention to firms' policies regarding discretionary disclosures. Prior studies argue that firms increase demand for their debt and equity issues and, thus, lower their cost of capital, by providing more informative disclosures. However, empirical research has generally not been able to document significant benefits from increased disclosure. This paper proposes an alternative explanation - firms disclose because it is the socially responsible thing to do. We argue that companies have incentives to engage in stakeholder management by undertaking socially responsible activities and that providing extensive and informative disclosures is one such practice. We examine the relationship between firms' disclosures and measures of social responsibility. We use ratings provided by the Council on Economic Priorities as proxies for the degree of social responsibility adopted by the sample firms. Disclosure rankings provided by the annual Association for Investment Management and Research Corporate Information Committee Reports (AIMR Reports) are used to measure disclosure level. Our results indicate that there is a positive relationship between disclosure level and corporate social responsibility. That is, firms that engage in socially responsive activities provide more informative and/or extensive disclosures than do companies that are less focused on advancing social goals. In addition, we find that socially responsible firms are more likely to provide this increased disclosure through better investor relations practices. These results support our contention that increased disclosure is a form of socially responsible behavior.

   Corporate social responsibility and "stakeholder management' versus a
   rights-based approach to sustainable development
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In the first paper in this trilogy (Boele et al., 2001) we described the history of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group from its inception in 1890 through to the year 2000, discussed briefly the importance of corporate reputation to the group and described the significant impacts on Shell of the events of 1995 in Nigeria. We traced the relationship of the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria to impacts on the natural and social environments of the Niger Delta and more specifically on the Ogoni. Finally we discussed the emergence of political resistance and significant conflict between Shell and the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and concluded that, despite significant apparent changes in attitude at the group level, distrust and antipathy towards Shell remained entrenched in Ogoni. In this second paper, we explore in more detail issues raised by economic globalization for the practice of corporate social responsibility and stakeholder management, and contrast these concepts with an alternative 'rights-based' approach to sustainable development. We relate our observations to Shell's current approach and conclude that the Shell group and specifically the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria may require an alternative approach to sustainable development if they wish to merit the full confidence of communities in areas of the world as complex and distressed as Ogoni.

TI Corporate social responsibility: A theory of the firm perspective

From these hypotheses, we conclude that there is an "ideal" level of CSR which managers can determine via: cost-benefit analysis, and that there is a neutral relationship between CSR and financial performance.

The concept of "the inclusive workplace," introduced here, refers to a work organization that is not only accepting and using the diversity of its own work force, but also is active in the community, participates in state and federal programs to include working poor people, and collaborates across cultural and national boundaries with a focus on global mutual interests. Using an ecosystems perspective, the article outlines a value-based model and a practice-based model of the inclusive workplace as they pertain to the different organizational levels, from the micro to the macro. Finally, implications for the social work profession are drawn with specific case examples for each system level.

TI Commentary on 'corporate strategies and environmental regulations: An
   organizing framework' by A. M. Rugman and A. Verbeke
SO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB A significant issue that is increasingly affecting the operations of companies is the policies of governments with regard to the natural environment and the activities of nongovernmental organizations in promoting codes of practice and other forms of nonlegal regulation.(1) The onset of new regulations and codes of conduct is placing significant operational burdens on firms to merely comply with new requirements and changed circumstances. Furthermore, there is a need in strategic terms to anticipate and to plan for environmental concerns and to incorporate this thinking into corporate strategy. Thus a new subfield of strategic management is beginning to emerge: that dealing with the natural environment as it affects corporate strategy. Alan Rugman and Alain Verbeke in their paper 'Corporate strategies and environmental regulations' organize the literature on environmental regulations and corporate strategy into a new managerial framework. They go on to develop a resource-based view of the interaction between the firm's key resources (core competences) and environmental regulations including the implications for the development of 'green' capabilities. Finally, they analyze the deployment of 'green' capabilities within a standard international business model and explore hypotheses on the relationships between environmental regulations, competitiveness, and corporate strategy. The question about how films should respond to environmental regulations can be seen in broad terms as parr of the debate on corporate social responsibility. A fundamental problem in this area has been that there are no definitions of corporate social responsibility or corporate social responsiveness that provide a framework or a model for consistent systematic collection, organization, and analysis of corporate data relating to these important concepts (Clarkson, 1995).

AB Individuals, groups, and government units have developed considerable interested in evaluating the social performance of corporations. Evaluating corporate social performance (CSP) is important for researchers investigating the relationship between different organizational measures and CSP and for stakeholders employing social performance information in their decision making models. To assess CSP, an aggregate measure of CSP which incorporates both an independent assessment of actual performance and the individual value judgements of the stakeholder is needed. In this study, Mle propose a methodology for the development of a systematic measure of CSP using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This multi-criteria decision making technique allows for the conversion of a multidimensional scale to a unidimensional scale, enabling analysis/comparison of companies both within the same industry and across industries. The technique is illustrated by developing a measure of CSP using several types of managers. The results indicate that there are large rank changes when individual value judgements are incorporated using relative importance weights.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Although brand theorists suggest that what a person knows about a company (i.e., corporate associations) can influence perceptions of the company's products, little systematic research on these effects exists. The authors examine the effects of two general types of corporate associations on product responses: One focuses on the company's capabilities for producing products, that is, corporate ability (CA) associations, and the other focuses on the company's perceived social responsibility, that is, corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations. The results of three studies, including one that measures respondents' CA and CSR associations for well-known companies and one that uses consumers recruited in a shopping mall, demonstrate that (1) what consumers know about a company can influence their beliefs about and attitudes toward new products manufactured by that company, (2) CA and CSR associations may have different effects on consumer responses to products, and (3) products of companies with negative associations are not always destined to receive negative responses. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for marketing managers and further research.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB It is generally assumed that common stock investors are exclusively interested in earning the highest level of future cash-flow for a given amount of risk. This view suggests that investors select a well-diversified portfolio of securities to achieve this goal. Accordingly, it is often assumed that investors are unwilling to pay a premium for corporate behavior which can be described as ''socially-responsible''
   Recently, this view has been under increasing attack. According to the Social Investment Forum, at least 538 institutional investors now allocate funds using social screens or criteria. In addition, Alice Tepper Marlin, president of the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities has recently estimated that about $600 billion of invested funds are socially-screened (1992).

AB This study examined the relationship between institutional investors and corporate social performance. Using corporate social performance data from the Fortune database, we demonstrated that institutional investors do not influence the social orientation of corporations. Further, the data seem to indicate that institutional investors are myopic with respect to a corporation's social position. However, there is support for the view that corporate social performance is an integral part of achieving a better match between an organization and the environment.

TI PREDICTING CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIVENESS - A MODEL DRAWN FROM 3
   PERSPECTIVES
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Most studies of corporate social responsiveness (CSR) focus on the relationship between CSR and profit. Here, we use three perspectives (institutional theory, economic theory and agency theory) to explain CSR. Industry norms, market share and indicators of management reputation predict variance in CSR. The combined perspectives improve understanding of both CSR and the CSR-profit relationship in two ways. First, they suggest that CSR levels and their relationship with profit will vary by industry. Second, they suggest that stock market measures and accounting measures will respond differently to CSR measures. Stock market measures lead, while accounting measures lag, CSR.

TI THE FORTUNE CORPORATE REPUTATION INDEX - REPUTATION FOR WHAT
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB This study examines competing measurement models of the Fortune reputation data and argues that, for research purposes, its usefullness is limited to measuring the extent to which a firm is perceived as striving for financial goals. The generalizability of this conclusion is evaluated and past research studies purporting to have measured other constructs (e.g., social responsibility, quality, stakeholder orientation) are revisited.

TI An investigation of corporate social responsibility reputation and
   economic performance
SO ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY
AB During the 1980s there was a rapid growth in tie United States of ethical, or socially responsible, investing Popular wisdom suggests that investors following this strategy may be trading off economic returns for psychic utility. However, in this paper we show that large U.S. manufacturing companies with better reputations for social responsibility outperformed companies with poorer reputations during the six-year period 1982-1987, and provided investors better stock market returns and lower risk The implications of these findings for the information content of accounting systems in a social welfare context, and for prescriptors in the business policy literature advocating a proactive social policy, are discussed.

TI PRELIMINARY SAFETY ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES
AB Various major safety studies are carried out at appropriate stages during a project. Many companies do some form of preliminary analysis at points between initial project concept and when the process design is completed. These studies aim to ensure that the decisions on process design and site selection take full account of process safety requirements and related risk and environmental constraints.
   Methods have been incorporated and developed during this work to take account of best industrial practice for such safety studies. These are listed under the general heading of preliminary safety analysis (PSA) and are carried out from the time of the concept safety review until such time as reasonably firm process flow diagrams or early P & I diagrams are available. The methods included are as follows: concept safety review (CSR) critical examination of system safety (CE) concept hazard analysis (CHA) preliminary consequence analysis (PCA) preliminary hazard analysis (PHA)
   These have been developed from a model of the plant and its interpretation as part of an incident scenario. The emphasis throughout is on utilizing the best points to start the search to identify undesired events contributing to the development of accidents.
   For the main method described, preliminary hazard analysis, this search has as its starting point and fulcrum the 'dangerous disturbances of plant' which arise at a point in the incident scenario just after emergency control measures have failed to control the situation. The study should be conducted using risk evaluation sheets which model each stage of the incident scenario and allow for a short-cut assessment of risk when this is desired.
   The above methods are demonstrated by part of a simplified case study. The methods function well and provide not only a good model of incident scenarios but are readily developed into fault and event trees and operating procedures. They are invaluable for the development of safety reports for regulatory authorities. Furthermore, by not imitating HAZOP methods they strengthen the effectiveness of the search process.
