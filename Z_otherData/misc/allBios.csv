"Shawna Smith","Shawna N. SmithShawna N. Smith is currently a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Michigan, where she splits her time between appointments in the Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab, based in the Survey Research Center at the Institute for Social Research, and the Division of General Medicine in the Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation at the University of Michigan Medical School. Her research career focuses on three broad topics: (1) models of change, and especially organizational and social change; (2) inequality, and particularly the interplay between social policy, social organization, and patterns of inequality; and (3) the importance of context, especially to the extent it ameliorates or exacerbates other social divisions. Shawna’s current work examines processes of policy implementation, and links between both (1) social context and organizational characteristics and implementation fidelity and/or innovation; and (2) fidelity in policy implementation as it relates to economic inequality and health disparities. Shawna received her Ph.D. in sociology from Indiana University and was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Oxford. She also teaches with the ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods.","http://www.gserm.ch/stgallen/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/Shawna-Smith.png"
